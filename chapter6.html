        <h2> CHAPTER VI.</h2>
        <h3>Appearance Of Country. </h3>
        <div class="simon">
            <p>This chapter mainly concerns the Whanganui and Hokianga regions. Jerningham will eventually spend a great
                deal of time in Whanganui, but this chapter isn't very relevant to most of that. There's some colourful
                interludes here, but I'm going to skip past a lot of the politics of the land purchasing, which follow
                similar patterns to what we saw in Wellington - hasty purchases made with whomever could be found on
                short notice, dubiously translated and negotiated in poor faith. The Waitangi Tribunal's Whanganui River
                Report has good details on all of this.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> IN the evening a fine breeze swept us past <i>Otaki;</i> and in the morning we were far
            north of the <i>Wanganui</i> river. <i>E Kuru</i> and his attendant were now fairly puzzled; they had never
            seen their country from further out at sea than they go in their canoes; and as all the land north of
            <i>Waikanae</i> is level and low for a great distance inland, so as not to bear any distinguishing features
            from the Strait, they confounded different parts of this monotonous coast.</div>
        <div class="simon">
            <p>Jerningham actually introduced "E Kuru" or "Kuru Kanga" in the previous chapter, in a section I skipped.
                He describes him as "principal chief" of Whanganui, and heaps praise upon his intelligence and
                hospitable attitude. E Kuru will act as the Wakefields' principal agent in Whanganui. It will come as no
                surprise to you then that the Waitangi Tribunal's report finds that "Kuru is not known to have been a
                leading rangatira". In fact, there's not much information at all on who this man really was.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapse1"
            aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse1">Sailing north to Hokianga</button>
        <div class="collapse" id="collapse1">
            <div class="jerningham"> Dicky, however, recognised the land as being between <i>Patea</i> and
                <i>Wanganui.</i> We therefore took advantage of a fine north-east breeze off the land to run along close
                to it, towards the place we sought. I remained in the main-top most of the day, gazing with delight on
                the extensive tract of level plains which stretched back far as the eye could reach from the edge of the
                cliffs which form the shore. Smokes from two or three bays to the northward appeared to invite our
                approach. As we ran along under all sail in the smooth water sheltered by the land, in some places
                within less than a mile of the shore, we at one place got into shoal water, six and then four fathoms as
                we neared a stony point. <i>E Kuru</i> warned us to stand off before his caution was confirmed by the
                lead. The weather was too thick for us to distinguish the mountains, which lie far distant to the east
                and south-east. We stood off for the night under easy sail; and found ourselves in the morning abreast,
                of the river's mouth, about three miles off. A sandspit on the south side seemed to shut up all but a
                narrow channel with foaming breakers. We now bade farewell to <i>E Kuru</i> and his attendant, who got
                into a boat with Barrett. The chief was landed at a <i>pa</i> about two miles up the river; and Barrett
                returned after sounding on the bar; just in time, for the wind had freshened fast from the time he left,
                and shifted round to west-north-west in a squall, so that we were soon obliged to beat off the coast
                under close-reefed topsails in a smart gale.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Barrett reported two fathoms as the shoalest water on the bar at half-ebb, and deep
                water when once inside. He described the natives as much alarmed at our close approach to the coast,
                dreading some repetition of the expedition made by the Alligator in 1834.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> We gathered from him that the coast is quite low, backed by barren sand hummocks,
                along the whole distance between <i>Waikanae</i> and <i>Wanganui;</i> to the north of which cliffs of
                moderate height commence, and continue all round, with but few interruptions, to the Sugar-loaf Islands.
            </div>
            <div class="jerningham"> During the next seven days we were tormented by fresh gales from between west and
                north during the day, and calm moonlight nights. In our various tacks towards the coast we could
                frequently distinguish breaks in the cliff, which Barrett recognised as the locations of <i>Te Namu,
                    Waimate,</i> and other spots rendered famous by the visits of the Alligator, and at which he had
                reposed during the great migration of the <i>Ngatiawa.</i></div>
            <div class="jerningham"> We enjoyed magnificent views of <i>Tonga Riro,</i> a high snowy mountain about
                ninety miles from the coast, in which the <i>Wanganui</i> takes its rise, and also of Mount Egmont or
                <i>Taranaki.</i> The latter forms a beautiful object from the sea. It rises gradually and evenly from a
                circle thirty or forty miles in diameter, one-third of which circle is formed by the sea. With the
                exception of a small group of low hills near the Sugar-loaf Islands, the land between the sea and the
                mountain forms an inverted amphitheatre, wooded down to within six or seven miles of the cliffs. The
                open ground seemed also interspersed with wooded portions. The <i>Ngatiawa</i> natives on board with
                Barrett almost cried with joy as they looked once more on what all the natives agree in describing as
                the garden of the country. We found soundings in all parts of the bay between <i>Kapiti</i> and Cape
                Egmont. The lead gave thirteen fathoms at three miles' distance from the entrance of <i>Wanganui.</i>
            </div>
            <div class="jerningham"> We at length anchored to the north of the middle Sugar-loaf Island, on the morning
                of the 27th, in eight fathoms. A long swell from S. W. made us roll very heavily.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> A volcanic peak at Sugar-loaf Point shoots up to the height of 500 feet. Two
                islands lie at the distances of one and two miles respectively to the westward; and several islets and
                extensive reefs are scattered about on the southern side of the point. Barrett went off in a whale-boat,
                accompanied by <i>E Ware</i> and <i>Tuarau,</i> the two young deputies from Port Nicholson; but he found
                the surf too heavy for landing. They succeeded in making themselves known to some natives on the beach,
                two of whom swam off through the surf, and came on board the Tory.</div>
            <h3>Native Greetings.</h3>
            <div class="jerningham"> An interesting scene now took place: <i>Maori</i> custom had prevented any
                communication in the boat; and even for some time after they had got on board, all four sat weeping on
                the deck, with their heads buried in their mats.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> One of the two strangers at length rose, and after the ceremony of rubbing noses
                had been performed by all, he related in a recitative dirge, beautifully affecting in its tone and
                expression, the hardships and dangers which had been endured by those on shore since the retreat of the
                main body of their relations. Their numbers, he said, had been wofully diminished by the predatory
                incursions of the <i>Waikato</i> war-parties. They had repeatedly been besieged in their strongholds on
                the peak or the islands; and, unable to trust themselves so far from places of refuge as to cultivate to
                any extent, had lived in a great measure on fish and fern-root. "But," he said, "though we muster now no
                more than threescore, we have determined to remain on our dear native land, and to struggle on through
                fear and hunger. We are glad to see our brothers from Port Nicholson, and our old White friend."</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> <i>Tuarau</i> answered them in an encouraging strain; telling them how he had
                brought White men to pay them for their land, and to protect them from their enemies; and how a like
                protection had been needed and secured by his fathers in the south. He drew a short sketch of our
                progress and intentions, and then delivered the advice of <i>Epuni and Warepori,</i> that they should
                sell <i>Taranaki</i> to their good <i>pakeha,</i> or White man.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> The next morning we landed Barrett and his train, including <i>Tuarau.</i> It was
                declared impossible to collect the different chiefs connected with the district of <i>Taranaki</i> in
                less than a week, as some of them resided far off. Colonel Wakefield, therefore, determined to leave
                Barrett here to prepare the natives for the sale, and to proceed himself at once to <i>Hokianga</i> <a
                    href="#note1" id="note_ref1">
                    <div class="superscript">1</div>
                </a>and <i>Kaipara,</i> two harbours in the north of the island, where he had to discover and take
                possession of certain districts which had been acquired by the Company from former purchasers before we
                left England. Dr. Dieffenbach was also persuaded by my uncle to land here, and seize the opportunity of
                examining Mount Egmont and the surrounding country, so highly interesting to the geologist, and of which
                so little was yet known from authentic sources. The surf was still exceedingly high on the beach; but
                the whale-boats landed Dicky and all his goods and chattels, animate and inanimate, by an early hour in
                the afternoon, and we weighed anchor and stood to the northward, before a fine fresh breeze.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> <i>E Ware</i> had determined to accompany Colonel Wakefield in his peregrinations;
                Jim Crow considered himself now as much attached to the ship as her figurehead; and a native of Rotoma
                (one of the South Sea Islands), named "Saturday," who had been whaling under Barrett, also made his
                choice for the Tory. </div>
            <h3>Hokianga--Signals.</h3>
            <div class="jerningham"> On the evening of the first of December, we came in sight of what we supposed to be
                the heads of <i>Hokianga.</i> We had on board some printed directions, given us in England, stating that
                a regular pilot lived at the entrance, and that a flag-staff on the south head was used to direct ships,
                by its signals, over the bar. As we could see no flag-staff, and as the sea appeared to break right
                across the entrance, we fired several guns, but received no answer. Accordingly, we stood off all night,
                and in the morning ran down about ten miles to the south, and found the real place. We had been last
                night off <i>Wangape</i> harbour, a place sometimes called False <i>Hokianga,</i> on account of its
                great similarity to this harbour. The thick weather had prevented any observations, and our dead
                reckoning had led us into this error. We passed safely over the bar, directed by the flag-staff, which
                is very ingeniously arranged, so as to incline to the right or left as may be required A vessel entering
                or going out has to obey its motions by standing in the corresponding direction. We found a
                quarter-less-four on the shoalest part of the bar, which was not breaking anywhere. The pilot, Mr.
                Martin, came on board after we had passed all the dangers, and took charge of the ship up the river.
            </div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Immediately at the entrance were high sand-hills; but the appearance of the banks
                improved, being clear and level for some way back as we advanced. About twenty miles up the river the
                banks had become irregular and wooded. At a place called the Narrows they approach one another within
                two ships' lengths, having been as much as a mile or two apart up to that place. Two or three miles
                above the Narrows, and twenty-six miles from the river's mouth, we anchored close to two other barques
                which were loading <i>kauri</i> timber for New South Wales. On the bank to our left was the house and
                store of a timber-dealer and general storekeeper. In front was a small flat island, on which were some
                sawyers' and blacksmiths' workshops. On either side of this island a tributary of the <i>Hokianga</i>
                flowed into the pool in which we lay. To the right a point of land just hid from us the buildings of the
                head Wesleyan mission. In ascending the river we had passed Herd's Point. This is a tract of land that
                was purchased by the agent of the Company of 1825, mentioned in the first chapter, which had become
                incorporated with the New Zealand Land Company. It is a tongue of land formed by the junction of two
                tributaries, and is quite level and covered with small wood. We heard that the portion purchased only
                comprised about half a square mile, and high hills bound its inner side.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> We found the whole country about the <i>Hokianga</i> river very irregular; and
                though there is a good deal of valuable and available land, it is much dispersed among steep hills, and
                intersected by innumerable creeks and mangrove-swamps. At low water the banks of the rivers have a most
                dismal appearance; these swamps and extensive banks of mud drying out to a considerable distance from
                the sound bank, and thus making the operation of landing extremely difficult and inconvenient.</div>
        </div>
        <h3>Wesleyan Mission--Mr. Bumby.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> During the next two days we visited different parts of the river. At <i>Mangungu,</i>
            the Wesleyan Missionary station above mentioned, we met with Mr. Bumby, then Chairman of the mission.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> We found in this gentleman a truly worthy teacher of the Christian religion. Endowed
            with considerable talents, which were improved by an excellent education, Mr. Bumby could bring enlarged
            views to bear on the appointed tasks of himself and his brother missionaries. His manners were conciliating,
            and essentially those of a gentleman and man of the world; and he willingly conceded that our efforts and
            those of the mission might work in perfect harmony. </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Mr. Bumby had visited Port Nicholson in the schooner which I before mentioned; and we
            now felt more than ever convinced that the native teachers left there had been led by jealousy to exceed
            their duties. He imagined, however, that he had secured the piece of ground at <i>Te Aro,</i> on which the
            houses and future chapel had been built. Colonel Wakefield told him how the natives had disregarded this
            verbal agreement unaccompanied by payment; but assured him that he would be at all times ready, in
            fulfilment of his instructions from the Company, to reserve a sufficient place in the future town for the
            location of a chapel and mission-house of each of the two stations.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Accompanied by Mr. Hobbs, another missionary, Mr. Bumby had walked along the coast from
            <i>Kapiti</i> to this place, doing much good on his way. In the course of our frequent visits to the
            mission, and his to the Tory, we collected a great deal of useful information, and acquired a strong
            friendship for the excellent Mr. Bumby. When he was afterwards unfortunately drowned by the upsetting of a
            canoe in the Frith of the Thames while in the pursuit of his praiseworthy labours, by none of his friends
            was he more sincerely regretted than by those who learned to esteem the virtues of his character at
            <i>Mangungu.</i></div>
        <div class="simon">
            <p>Bumby's glowing eulogy from Jerningham here probably owes as much to the man not living long enough to
                get on Jerningham's bad side as to any of the man's own qualities. He'd been in New Zealand less than a
                year at the time of meeting Jerningham, though he'd already met Te Rauparaha, and preached (in English)
                at Petone and Te Aro. It was Bumby who had reserved land for a Wesleyan mission at Te Aro. (Dictionary
                of New Zealand Biography, 1940)</p><img src="images/bumby.jpg" title="Reverend J. H. Bumby (1808–1840)
                William Gush (1813–1888)
                Oxford Brookes University, Harcourt Hill" class="inset">
            <p>"Wesleyan" here refers not to the Wesleyan Church (which was not founded until 1843), but to the English
                Wesleyan Mission, a very small Methodist organisation which first sent missionaries to New Zealand in
                1823.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> At the mission were some poor farm-buildings; a press, which was worked by natives
            under the direction of Mr. Woon, the printer; and a very nice chapel. The buildings were of <i>kauri</i>
            timber, which works up very well. The rooms lined with this wood, carefully planed, had the neat appearance
            of a work-box.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> In different places along the banks of the river, huge logs of this valuable wood lay
            ready for sale or embarkation. The few natives about the settlement were extensively employed in lumbering,
            and made large profits by this work and the sale of the trees. We were much struck, however, by the
            difference of character as well as physical appearance of the natives here in comparison with those of our
            friends in Cook's Strait. The latter had appeared far superior in stature and muscular power. There was
            here, moreover, none of the same eagerness to supply a ship with provisions. In all the harbours of Cook's
            Strait, we had always been surrounded by canoes, bearing more than sufficient for our consumption. Here, on
            the contrary, it was difficult to procure fresh provisions, even by sending to the residence of the chiefs.
            Entirely borne away by the high profits arising from the great competition between White men for the
            <i>kauri</i> logs, they neglected to cultivate the ground, and disdained going in their canoes to catch any
            of the fish which abound near the heads. During the whole time that we lay here, we had not a single canoe
            come alongside for the purpose of barter, and were obliged to procure our fresh provisions at an exorbitant
            price from a haggling White dealer.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> The rest of the natives, who are all professed Christians, were accustomed to collect
            from different parts of the neighbourhood on the Saturday afternoon, in order to be in readiness for the
            morrow's services. They occupied a collection of temporary huts at the foot of the gentle slope on which the
            chapel and mission are built. I was much struck by their miseable outward appearance. They were wretchedly
            clothed, covered with dirt, badly supplied with food, generally speaking weak and sickly-looking, and
            altogether more abject in their manners and miserable in their condition than the slaves at the
            <i>Ohiere;</i> who, however poor and degraded, had at least some lightness of heart and physical energy. The
            missionary natives showed no curiosity as to us, and hardly turned their heads to answer a question; they
            seemed to have lost all the <i>Maori's</i> natural vivacity and inquisitiveness, and to be a generation
            whose feelings and natures were blunted.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> In a word, they appeared tamed without being civilized. Together with the ferocity they
            had lost the energy of the savage, without acquiring either the activity or the intelligence of a civilized
            man.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> They performed, however, their part of the religious ceremonies on Sunday with great
            order and decorum; joining universally in the responses and hymns, and listening with marked attention to
            the sermon which followed.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> On the Monday they again disappeared; having excited no feeling in my mind but that of
            sincere pity for their degraded physical state.</div>
        <h3>Lieutenant Macdonnell</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> About two miles above <i>Mangungu,</i> we found the establishment of Lieutenant
            Macdonnell, who had been some years in this country, and who had sold his claims to certain districts of
            land here and at <i>Kaipara</i> to the Company. We had left him in England, but had brought with us his
            deeds for the lands in question, and letters to his agent, Mr. Mariner. A brig was loading <i>kauri</i>
            spars at the river-side. A nice wooden house, belonging to Lieutenant Macdonnell, stood on a terrace about
            fifty yards back from the river. Mr. Mariner had a comfortable cottage on the bank below, buried in the
            midst of flourishing gardens. The fig and prickly pear were growing well in the open air; and a vineyard,
            with three hundred and fifty vines of different sorts, promised great things. Some cattle belonging to Mr.
            Macdonnell were running on the tops of the hills, and one of these, which we bought for the ship, was very
            fair meat.</div>
        <div class="simon">
            <p>Lieutenant Thomas Macdonnell, like Colonel Kurz from Conrad's Heart of Darkness, lived in baronial
                splendour, replicating a tiny sliver of England far from those shores. His residence had vinyards,
                orchards, housing for staff, and even apparently his own battery of cannon. Grown rich from the kauri
                trade, he made substantial purchases in Hokianga.</p>
            <p>He seems to have been a contentious figure, and quarrelled and litigated with several parties for most of
                his life. His son, also Thomas, would go on to have a distingushed role in the New Zealand Wars of the
                1860s. (<a href="https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1m33/mcdonnell-thomas">Te Ara</a>)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> De Thierry's wild scheme of assuming the sovereignty of New Zealand was of course
            opposed by the natives and White settlers of the Bay of Islands and <i>Hokianga.</i> Mr. Busby printed a
            circular to the chiefs, inviting them to resist his designs; and the Church missionaries took active
            measures for their overthrow. On arriving in New Zealand in 1835, he was much disappointed when he found his
            visionary scheme quite unlikely to succeed; and he was also foiled in the more legitimate hope of acquiring
            an indisputable title to a large tract of land, by means of the 700<i>l</i>. which he had given to Mr.
            Kendal for that purpose.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> It appeared that Mr. Kendal had purchased some land for <i>thirty-six axes;</i> and De
            Thierry had been involved in constant disputes with the vendors and their sons ever since. On one occasion
            he sent to Colonel Wakefield for protection against an aggression meditated upon him and his family by a
            turbulent young chief, in consequence of a dispute about the ownership of some logs of timber. An armed boat
            from the Tory, sent up to his residence, had the effect of maintaining peace, until a chief named
            <i>Nene</i> or Thomas Walker, who was much on board our ship, had been persuaded by my uncle to go and
            pacify the aggressor, his own brother. Colonel Wakefield himself paid the Baron a visit, and described his
            family as exceedingly interesting and well-bred, but suffering from distress and constant alarm.</div>
        <div class="simon">
            <p>Charles Philippe Hippolyte de Thierry is as colourful a character as you could find in New Zealand
                history. A serial speculator, schemer and fabulist, he attempted to barter his notional ownership of a
                vast tract of land in New Zealand into a governorship, trying and failing to involve both the Dutch and
                the French crowns in the affair. Some of his other schemes included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A partnership in a Paris bazaar</li>
                <li>Five years in the Americas, possibly looking for gold</li>
                <li>Building a canal in Panama</li>
                <li>Electing himself King of Nuku Hiva, in the Marquesas Islands</li>
                <li>Panning for gold in Califonia</li>
                <li>Teaching music (he was a talented violinist)</li>
                <li>Flax milling</li>
            </ul>
            <p>He died in Auckland in 1864, a friend of Governor George Grey. (<a

        <div class="jerningham"> We saw nothing of the Roman Catholic Bishop, Monseigneur Pompalier, who, we were told,
            had lately bought land for a missionary station on the banks of the river, and made many converts. He had
            been attacked by both sects of Protestant missionaries in the most intolerant manner.</div>

            <h3>Purchase Of Deeds Of Wairau.</h3>
            <div class="jerningham"> Colonel Wakefield took formal possession for the Company of Herd's Point, and of a
                district of land opposite called <i>Motukaraka,</i> bought of Mr. Macdonnell, in the presence of the
                original vendors. He then sent a messenger over to the Bay of Islands, to procure the attendance of
                <i>Rewa</i> and some of the other chiefs of the <i>Ngapuhi</i> tribe, who had made a cession of some
                land on the banks of the <i>Kaipara</i> river to Mr. Macdonnell.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> This gentleman had obtained from the chiefs of the <i>Ngapuhi</i> a promise in
                writing to sell him a tract of land on the <i>Kaipara,</i> which they had recently conquered, provided
                he brought a vessel into that river. He had effected this with the <i>Tui,</i> a small schooner built at
                <i>Hokianga</i>; and his consequent right of pre-emption had been bought by the Company.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> We met the chiefs assembled at <i>Hauraki,</i> Mr. Macdonnell's station; and they
                confirmed the agreement, and deputed a chief named <i>Taonui</i> to go with us to <i>Kai- para</i> and
                show us the land in question.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Previous to sailing, Colonel Wakefield purchased from a lady, representing herself
                to be the widow of Captain Blenkinsopp, some deeds professing to be the original conveyances of the
                plains of <i>Wairau</i> by <i>Rauperaha, Rangihaeata,</i> and others to that gentleman, in consideration
                of a ship-gun. They were signed with elaborate drawings of the <i>moko</i> or <i>tatu</i> on the chiefs'
                faces. </div>
            <div class="jerningham"> On the 16th of December, we set sail for <i>Kaipara.</i></div>
            <div class="jerningham"> On the evening of the 18th, we anchored in ten fathoms, on the tail of one of the
                extensive banks which lie outside the entrance of that harbour to the distance of five or six miles from
                the land. We caught in two hours enough snapper to last the whole ship's company for many days.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="simon">
            <p>This next passage isn't of particular historical interest, but it is exciting and interesting so I've
                left it in.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>A Cool Man-Of-War's Man.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> 19th. --This morning I was awakened by Dr. Dorset, who told me that we were aground. As
            I was swinging in a cot, I could not feel any bumping, and treated his announcement as a joke. On his
            repeated statements, however, I put my foot on deck, and soon felt a tremendous bump. I dressed in haste and
            hurried on deck.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> We had trusted almost entirely to a chart with which we had been furnished by
            Lieutenant Macdonnell in England, and which proved totally erroneous, omitting any description of a bank
            which lay in the midst of the main channel as drawn by him. As it was quite calm, we had been towing in with
            three boats ahead on the top of the flood-tide, and no breakers had pointed out the shoal water. One cast of
            the lead had given twelve fathoms; and the next, "quarter-less-three" and a heavy bump. A long rolling swell
            from the westward was increasing in force every minute.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> The usual measures to get the ship off were taken, but in vain. Captain Chaffers and
            the well-disciplined crew exerted themselves most creditably. Five of our guns, three or four anchors and
            cables, a deck-load of spare spars which we had taken in at <i>Hokianga,</i> and several other heavy
            articles, were thrown overboard. Kedges were carried out and hauled upon, but with no effect. Some heavy
            mill-stones and paving-flags were got up out of the hold and rolled overboard. One of them was carelessly
            sent through our best whale-boat, which lay at the gangway.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> During half-an-hour the ship continued to bump heavily. An old man-o'-war's man, who
            had joined us in Plymouth Sound, amused me much by his determined <i>sang froid</i> on this occasion. He
            happened to have been in the Pique frigate, on the famous voyage which she made across the Atlantic without
            a rudder after striking on a rock on the coast of Newfoundland <button class="inline"
                data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#info1" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="info1">i</button>
            <div id="info1" class="info collapse width">The incident with the Pique had occurred only four years prior,
                in 1835. </div>. He was now at the helm; and coolly rolled his quid in his mouth, as he related in a low
            tone the more appalling dangers of that adventure, or warned me to keep further from the wheel, each time
            that a bump of the rudder made it spin round like the fly-wheel of a steam-engine. "This is only soft sand,"
            said he; "I've been bumping on hard rocks for a day and night and no harm done: shear a <i>little</i>
            further off the wheel, sir, and mind your legs with them chains, --then a bump and whir-r-r-r went the
            wheel-- only soft sand, sir!" as he rolled his quid over, and again handled the wheel. "All right, sir," to
            an inquiring glance from the captain as to the feel of the rudder--then another great bump, and warning, and
            whirling, and rolling of the quid, and then he resumed his yarn as quietly as if nothing were the matter.
        </div>
        <h3>Perils In A Boat.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> The tide having ebbed, it became impossible that the vessel should come off until the
            next flood. Colonel Wakefield mustered a crew of volunteers from the cabin to pull ashore in the whale-boat
            which remained whole, and obtain assistance from the Navarino, a vessel which we had been told at
            <i>Hokianga</i> was loading spars about thirty miles up the river. We thus left the most useful men on
            board, with the longboat and cutter, the two best boats. <i>E Ware,</i> Saturday <button class="inline"
                data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#info2" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="info2">i</button>
            <div id="info2" class="info collapse width">"Saturday" was a native of Rotuma (now in the Republic of Fiji),
                and a whaling colleague of Dicky Barret's, introduced in a previous section.</div>, Mr. Heaphy, Dr.
            Robinson, Dr. Dorset, and myself were to pull at the oars, thus having one spare hand to relieve the tired;
            and Colonel Wakefield steered.
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Just previous to our leaving, the cutter had towed the long-boat, bearing one of the
            anchors, to some distance from the ship, and dropped the anchor in order to get a heave on it the next tide.
            The violence of the ebb, which now ran like a sluice past the ship, had prevented them from towing the empty
            long-boat back; and they had found it extremely difficult to pull only the cutter back, double-banking the
            oars. In our haste we had forgotten to notice this circumstance; and we were no sooner out of the eddy
            formed by the ship, than we were hurried along seawards, notwithstanding all our efforts.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> The heavy swell had now begun to break on the outer edge of the shoals, and the roar
            sounded louder and louder in our ears as we drifted nearer to the breakers. The day was cloudless, and the
            sun, nearly at the zenith, distressingly hot. The chronometers and deeds had been placed in the
            stern-sheets' for safety, but not a drop of water. We worked until we could perspire no longer, and then the
            toil was excessively painful, An ineffectual attempt to anchor in one of the channels had only lost us
            ground, the line having proved too short; and we were soon within a quarter of a mile of the outer breakers,
            which seemed to menace certain destruction. When in the boat, we had been unable to distinguish the deep
            channel, as it is tortuous, and several smaller channels perplex the observer so near the level of the
            water, and the tide appeared to set across both channels and banks.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> The spot where the vessel struck was two or three miles from the sea; and we were now
            so far to seaward of the ship, that we were invisible to those on board.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Just as we had given ourselves up for lost, a faint breath of air was felt from
            seaward; one of the natives' blankets was extended between two stretchers in the bow; and this, with the
            unremitting efforts of the rowers, kept us in about the same position for two or three hours, till the
            flood-tide made.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Even then we were not in perfect safety; the flood set so strongly to the northward
            that we became involved among new breakers. Saturday, however, here took the steer-oar, and steered us with
            great presence of mind through a threatening line of surf; when we found ourselves in a smooth channel,
            gliding towards the harbour at the rate of five knots. Each rested on his oar, and we now paused, to
            establish a better mast and sail with a blanket stretched on two of them.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> I shall never forget the pleasure of the first drink of water at the rill on a beach
            near the North Head.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> We pulled and sailed about twenty miles up the harbour, which is a great estuary, five
            or six miles wide, receiving the waters of several rivers; and had just gained sight of the vessel's masts
            about ten miles from us, on rounding a point to the north, which opened a view of the <i>Wairoa</i> or
            "Long-water" river, when the tide turned against us. We were thus obliged to land on the nearest beach, and
            encamp till the flood. As we had worked hard since the morning, without even breakfasting, this arrangement
            was agreeable enough to us; and some tin cans of preserved meat, and our small store of biscuit, were soon
            finished. Clouds of mosquitoes, however, defeated our attempts to sleep. The smoke of the fire had scarcely
            any effect on them, and while our eyes were filled with wood-smoke, they were stinging our knees and every
            other part of our bodies that was unprotected by anything thicker than duck. Half-burying oneself in the
            sand, smoking, expeditions to distant parts of the shore, or among the fern at the back of the beach, and up
            the small hills by which it was skirted, --all proved unavailing to get rid of these terrible enemies; and
            at the first dawn of day, as soon as the tide had turned, we were glad to leave the inhospitable beach and
            get into the boat, stiff and unrefreshed. Even the natives had exclaimed against the numbers and
            perseverance of the <i>nai-nai,</i> as the mosquitoes are called in <i>Maori.</i> Saturday's stolid
            unconcerned face was rich to behold, as he sat by the fire stirring them out of each ear with a small twig.
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> A few hours' pull brought us alongside the Navarino; where we were most kindly received
            by Captain Warming, as soon as we had told our doleful tale. He treated us with the most genuine
            hospitality, and immediately dispatched his mate, with an efficient boat's crew, to the assistance of our
            shipmates.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> After some breakfast and a refreshing bath, I slept soundly for some hours; and, soon
            after getting up, had the satisfaction of seeing the Tory come full sail round the point near to which we
            had passed the night. She had forged over the bank into deep water, after being exposed for some hours to
            heavy seas which broke over her. The mate of the Navarino had met her coming into the harbour, and piloted
            her up the next morning to a berth nearly alongside of the Navarino.</div>

            aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse3">Returning to Wellington</button>
        <div class="collapse" id="collapse3">
            <h3>Wairoa River.</h3>
            <div class="jerningham"> The vessel was so much injured as to require heaving down, and thus it became
                necessary to take out all the cargo and ballast. It was plain that she would not be again fit for
                service for a month or two; and the time was fast approaching when Colonel Wakefield had engaged to meet
                the first fleet of emigrant-ships at Port Hardy in Cook's Strait. As we could not tell, before leaving
                England, where the first settlement would be formed, and as the emigrants were to sail in August, a
                rendezvous had been anointed at this known good harbour for the 10th of January 1840. Colonel Wakefield
                therefore determined to proceed overland to the Bay of Islands, in order to charter a small vessel to
                take him to Port Hardy, and then join us here.</div>
            <h3>Wairoa River.</h3>
            <div class="jerningham"> Before starting, he held some communication with the natives of this place, a few
                of whom were encamped abreast of the ship. They had laughed at <i>Taonui</i> and the claim of the
                <i>Ngapuhi</i> chiefs to tell their land for them. They acknowledged that they had been conquered in
                former times, but said that they had long returned from their places of refuge, and were not disposed to
                be conquered again. They firmly refused even to sell the land in question to Colonel Wakefield; but
                offered to sell a district on the banks of another river, flowing into the north-eastern end of the
                estuary.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Abandoning the task of examining, and, if of value, buying this tract, to Dr.
                Dorset, whom he left in charge of affairs for the Company, Colonel Wakefield started in one of our boats
                up the <i>Wairoa</i> river on the 26th December. He had understood that a day's walk from the head of
                this river would take him to the Bay of Islands. <i>E Ware</i> and Saturday accompanied him, to carry
                his baggage. Messrs. Heaphy, Robinson, and Dorset formed part of the boat's crew, in order to see as
                much as possible of the river.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> I was laid up at this time by inflammation from the bites of mosquitoes which I had
                got in bathing at <i>Hokianga;</i> and I gladly accepted Captain Warming's kind offer of one of his
                cabins while the repairs of the Tory should go on.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> On the 29th, the boat returned, having landed Colonel Wakefield about one hundred
                miles up the river. The party described the river as navigable for shipping up to that point, and the
                banks as clothed with the finest <i>kauri</i> timber, from twenty miles above our anchorage. They had
                passed several sawyers' and lumberers' stations, and also stations of the Wesleyan and Catholic
                missions. They described the mosquitoes to be in great numbers and extraordinary vigour in every place
                where they had stopped.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> All the cargo was now landed and stored under tents ashore. The cabin-party also
                established an encampment under a cliff nearly abreast of the anchorage. The Tory was hove down on a
                sand-bank at the first spring-tide, on the 4th of January; and, after a survey by Captains Chaffers and
                Warming, the necessary repairs were proceeded with. During this interval, the Bee brig from Sydney
                arrived and proceeded up the river. We also had a visit from Mr. W. C. Symonds, a son of Sir William
                Symonds, whom I had known in London; and who had come out as agent for a Scotch company, which had
                bought land at <i>Manukau,</i> a harbour about thirty miles south of this. Mr. Symonds was only
                accompanied by one White man; and described the natives as having been exceedingly dishonest and
                troublesome in all their transactions with him. He had crossed the isthmus which lies between the
                innermost part of the harbour of <i>Manukau</i> and the east coast, and had obtained a view of the
                eastern sea. He had endured considerable hardships and privations; and returned to his station up the
                <i>Kaipara</i> river some days after, having provided himself with some necessaries. The latter river
                flows into the estuary on its south side, taking its source very near the harbour of <i>Manukau.</i> A
                great inland water-communication thus exists along the northern part of the North Island, commencing
                near the isthmus between the two coasts, and ending at the spot up the <i>Wairoa</i> where Colonel
                Wakefield left the river; from which short overland paths communicate with the Bay of Islands and
                <i>Hokianga.</i>
            </div>
            <h3>Neighbourhood Of Kaipara.</h3>
            <div class="jerningham"> The land, however, in the neighbourhood of <i>Kaipara</i> harbour and its
                tributaries is far from promising in appearance. The part near the anchorage is chiefly table-land clear
                of timber; and the barren clay of which it consists seems to refuse sustenance to anything but stunted
                fern. In the valleys cut out of the table-land by sluggish streams there are dull swamps which might
                furnish more available land when drained.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> The amateur boat's crew described some of the land higher up the river as of a
                better character, especially some hundred acres under excellent cultivation at the Wesleyan mission
                station.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Mr. White, the former Chairman of the Wesleyan mission, had chartered the Navarino,
                and visited her once while she was taking in the splendid spars which were rafted down by natives.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> This gentleman had been discharged from the service of the mission some few years
                before, on account of his having engaged very extensively in land-buying and trading of all sorts. He
                was a great land-owner on the banks of the <i>Hokianga</i> and <i>Kaipara</i> rivers; and maintained a
                good deal of the influence which he had acquired as a missionary, by retaining the clerical habit and
                continuing to pray and preach to the natives, even while bargaining with them in his secular capacity.
                Mr. White had quarrelled, when in England, with some of the projectors of our scheme there, and had
                threatened to oppose us by means of his influence</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> with the natives. We had, of course, now no dread of his interference, as he was
                not even known in Cook's Strait, where the more important part of our purchases and friendly relations
                with the aborigines were already firmly established.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> About the middle of January, the Guide brig arrived, bringing letters from Colonel
                Wakefield to Dr. Dorset and myself. Mr. John Blackett, formerly a mate in the navy, who had obtained a
                passage in the brig from my uncle in order to join the Navarino here on her voyage to England, was the
                bearer of these. He had been travelling about much in the interior of the island for some months,
                chiefly in the <i>Waikato</i> and Thames districts. He expressed a strong interest in our proceedings;
                and hoped, as Captain Warming had promised to accompany the Tory as far as Port Nicholson when her
                repairs were completed, to get a glimpse of the first operations of the settlers before he should return
                to England.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Colonel Wakefield informed us, shortly, that he had reached Port Hardy on the 11th
                of January, without finding any ship from England; and he instructed Dr. Dorset to put some goods on
                board the Guide and proceed to <i>Taranaki,</i> in order to complete the purchase there, and bring
                Barrett and Dr. Dieffenbach to Port Nicholson. If we reached the latter place before him, we were to get
                the natives to build plenty of temporary huts, in readiness for the emigrants. He had chartered the
                Guide by the month. </div>
            <div class="jerningham"> This brig was an old whaler belonging to Sydney; originally a Calcutta pilot-brig,
                teak-built, of about 150 tons burden, and swarming with cockroaches.</div>
            <h3>A Dangerous Voyage.</h3>
            <div class="jerningham"> A crew had been collected by the great personal exertions of Colonel Wakefield and
                Mr. Blackett, at the Bay of Islands, and consisted of the worst class of run-away sailors, and probably
                worse regular "beach- combers" of <i>Kororareka.</i> The captain was a lazy, indolent old man, fond of
                grog, and of sleep, and of a good charter by the month. The mate was the former doctor of the vessel
                when whaling, perfectly ignorant of navigation and seamanship, and, like the captain, perfectly devoid
                of influence over the rascally crew.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Dr. Dorset, Doddrey the storekeeper, and I, were the only ones who took up our
                berths on board. The necessary quantity of goods being on board, we proceeded down the river; and, on
                the morning of the 29th of January, left the Heads with a light south-east breeze and ebb-tide. The
                captain got up to the mast-head, and a hulking, cowardly, half-bred Dutch sailor placed himself in the
                chains to sound. The breeze died away as we got to the perilous pass between the "middle patch," on
                which the Tory had been wrecked, and the south sand-bank. The ebb-tide set us broadside on to the patch,
                on which there was a heavy break. The coward in the chains began to holloa with fright as soon as the
                water shoaled to five fathoms; the skipper scrambled down from his high perch, and looked quite
                perplexed; the crew rushed aft, and lowered the boats after the vessel had bumped heavily two or three
                times, and jumped in without any attention to rules of precedence. In such a hurry was this done, that
                ten men jumped into one of the boats before the plug-hole was stopped, and only two got into the other,
                when both pulled away, leaving me and two of the crew in a very disagreeable situation on board. The
                brig bumped away at a great rate; but we three managed to brail up the spanker; which caused the brig to
                be head on to the swell instead of side on, and probably saved her. One of the boats was at last
                persuaded to approach near</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> enough to the stern for us to watch an opportunity and drop ourselves in; and we
                set off to pull for the shore.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> The ebb-tide, however, pushed the brig along every time she lifted; and this
                movement was aided by the breeze, which again sprang up and filled the square- sails which we had left
                set; in a few minutes our vessel was going along, clear of the shoal, and all sails drawing. We had a
                hard task to catch her and save her from sailing on to the north bank; but at length got her clear of
                all dangers, and stood out to sea. We found she did not leak much, and trusted that no serious damage
                had been done.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Constant southerly gales detained us at sea for some days. During one of these, I
                was much surprised at the way adopted by the captain and crew to make all snug without trouble to
                anybody.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> One morning, on coming up on deck from the 'tween-decks where I had slung my cot, I
                found a hard gale blowing and heavy sea running, the brig being hove-to under a close reefed
                main-top-sail, with the helm lashed a-lee, and no one on deck or in the rigging. I looked into the
                cabin. The skipper, the medical mate, and Dr. Dorset were all snoring. I went forward and peeped down
                the scuttle into the forecastle, where the same happy oblivion prevailed. Doddrey was fast asleep in the
                'tween-decks; and I thus found myself the only person awake on board. The old brig, however, was an
                excellent sea-boat, and rode it out like a tub as she was; and I did not disturb the sleepers, knowing
                we had plenty of sea-room. The next time I saw the skipper awake, he told me this was a common practice
                in whalers; and said it was quite useless to tire the people by thrashing about in heavy weather. He was
                very good fun with his rough navigation. He had a rickety</div>
            <h3>Sugar-Loaf Islands.</h3>
            <div class="jerningham"> parallel ruler, a very doubtful quadrant, and a rusty pair of compasses, by means
                of which he used to make a determined guess at the position of the ship every day at noon. Having
                ascertained this to his own satisfaction, he would draw a cross of large size on the map, and declare
                that to be our actual position, with much emphasis. He denied the existence of any such thing as
                variation of the compass; and retired upon his dignity as commander whenever any approach was made to
                inquiry as to the data on which he founded his calculations.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> We at length managed to come in sight of the Sugar-loaf Islands on the 1st of
                February, and anchored to the north of the inner one, <i>Moturoa,</i> or "High Island," in the
                afternoon. Barrett came off from the island and piloted her to the anchorage. The Acquilla cutter came
                in from the southward and anchored about the same time. Mr. White was on board; and Barrett told us that
                he had been here once before, since he left <i>Kaipara,</i> trying to buy the <i>Taranaki</i> district,
                but had been foiled by Dicky's superior influence.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Dr. Dorset and I landed on <i>Moturoa,</i> and clambered up the sides of this
                conical rock to a terrace about 100 feet above the sea, where our friends had taken up their abode. We
                found ourselves in a niche about twenty yards in circumference, sheltered by an over-arching rock. In
                one corner was a <i>ware puni,</i> occupied by Barrett and his family, and in the middle a <i>wata,</i>
                or "storehouse," stuck upon four poles about six feet high, and only approachable by a wooden log with
                steps cut in it. We were received cordially by <i>E Rangi</i> and the children, Barrett's black cook
                Lee, Dr. Dieffenbach, "Worser," the whaler whom I before mentioned as having piloted the <i>Tokerau</i>
                whaler into <i>Kapiti</i> roads, and six or seven natives of both sexes.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Barrett now related to us all that had occurred since we left him here. In the
                first place, constant rumours had been brought down the coast of fresh invasions projected from
                <i>Waikato.</i> In readiness for these, he had removed all his family and goods to the island, and the
                natives had stored it with firewood and potatoes. Numerous parties of released slaves had passed along
                from the northward to their native places further south, spreading all the missionary doctrines; and
                never omitting to preach the uncharitable one of calling all White men <i>rewera,</i> or "devils," who
                were not missionaries, or to warn the natives against selling their lands to us, who would, they said,
                drive them away to the mountains. A variation of this calumny was that we were <i>Pikapo,</i> (the
                <i>Maori</i> corruption of <i>episcopoi,</i> or Roman Catholics,) and would therefore infallibly cut
                their throats or drive them away.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Some White missionaries, and also some lay White traders from <i>Kawia</i> and
                other places to the north, had on more than one occasion headed these agitating parties; and had
                distinguished themselves by vehement support of these statements and determined attempts to obtain the
                land for themselves.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Mr. White had, on his former visit, asserted his claim to the district; as founded
                on his purchase of the rights of a large number of inhabitants of <i>Taranaki,</i> originally made
                captive by the <i>Waikato</i> tribe, but now freed at <i>Hokianga, Kaipara,</i> and other places since
                their masters had embraced the Christian religion.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> The natives residing at <i>Nga Motu,</i> or "the Islands," as the land abreast of
                them is called, refused to acknowledge this claim; saying very truly, that they who had never lost caste
                by servitude, or taken refuge in a distant land from the persecutions of their enemies, like</div>
            <h3>Mr. White--His Letters.</h3>
            <div class="jerningham"> the slaves to the north or their relations in Cook's Strait, had the best right to
                sell the district. They had also declined Mr. White's offers to buy their claims; stating that they had
                promised to sell it according to <i>E Tiki</i> or Dicky's recommendation, and that they meant to keep
                their word. </div>
            <div class="jerningham"> In short, Barrett's influence and perseverance had effectually conquered numerous
                efforts made to outbid us in this purchase. Too great praise could not be given to him for the zeal
                which he had shown in supporting our interests, or his disinterestedness in refusing the offers of some
                of these parties, even though we had much exceeded the time we had named for our return, and the natives
                were becoming daily more impatient for the conclusion of the bargain. The next morning a native brought
                off from the main, where Mr. White had landed, letters to Barrett and to Colonel Wakefield. The latter
                was opened by Dr. Dorset, as acting agent. They both contained a statement from the worthy
                ex-missionary, that "he had bought the land bounded by the <i>Wanganui</i> and <i>Mokau</i> rivers, and
                a line between their sources, from the <i>Waikato</i> and <i>Ngatimaniapoto</i> tribes; and that if we
                persisted in buying this district from the resident natives, those former conquerors had determined to
                recommence hostilities, or to claim the protection of the British Government in securing their rights."
            </div>
            <div class="jerningham"> The natives were very angry on hearing the contents of these letters, and we had
                some trouble in preventing them from going to break up the boat in which Mr. White had landed. As we
                landed, he retired from the beach, where he had been preaching and praying with some of them, to a less
                conspicuous situation. A <i>Waikato</i> chief, who had come in the cutter with him, reassured us and the
                resident natives.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> He said that White had given some tobacco and a few blankets to the <i>Waikato</i>
                as payment for those whom they lost at <i>Taranaki,</i> which any one buying this land would have to do
                in accordance with native custom. "But," said he, "we have not sold your land; more than half the
                <i>Waikato</i> are missionaries now, and these will join with you, as brothers, against any invasion
                from their heathen countrymen."</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> I ascended <i>Paretutu,</i> or "Obstinate Cliff," the Sugar-loaf Peak on the main,
                to-day, accompanied by Dr. Dieffenbach. It is nearly five hundred feet high; and almost perpendicular on
                the side next the sea, whose sullen roar against its base sounds diminished to the ear. The two islands,
                <i>Moturoa,</i> and <i>Motuomahanga,</i> or "Isle of Refuge," appear like rocks to seaward. Inland, a
                magnificent extent of country meets the eye. For some miles from the coast it seemed clear from wood;
                then were extensive park-like glades and groves on the edge of the forest, which rolled far eastward in
                soft undulating lines. Mount Egmont's snowy peak towered out of the clouds at fifteen miles' distance,
                and <i>Tonga Riro,</i> at least ninety miles distant, appeared more to the north, glistening over the
                most distant forest ridge. Cape Egmont to the south-west ran down gradually to a point, one gently
                curved line extending from the sea to the summit of Mount Egmont. To the north a spacious bay extended
                to near Albatross Head at the entrance of <i>Kawia,</i> dotted in its centre by some remarkable white
                cliffs, called <i>Parenunui,</i> or "Large Cliffs." On the top of <i>Paretutu</i> we observed two or
                three pits, the remains of places of refuge of the <i>Ngatiawa</i> from their enemies.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> This evening a strong north-west gale set in. In this case the anchorage becomes
                dangerous, and the cutter,</div>
            <h3>The "Guide" In Danger.</h3>
            <div class="jerningham"> whose captain was warned by Barrett of the approaching storm, hove up her anchor
                and walked away to windward in the first of it. Our skipper, who had irresolutely postponed his
                determination to the last, at length slipped his anchor, and stood under easy sail to the northward.
                Unable to tack, he came back after wearing, evidently in a worse position than before; and dusk,
                accompanied by a whirling tempest of wind, lightning, and rain, hid the brig from our sight. Clinging
                hard to the rock in one of the crannies on the northern side of <i>Moturoa,</i> we lit a beacon-fire,
                and made out a light on board which proved her to have anchored again just outside the surf.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> We crept into the <i>wata,</i> appointed for the sleeping-place of Dr. Dorset, Dr.
                Dieffenbach, myself, and two natives, with no pleasant anticipations as to the fate of the brig. The
                gale had come on so suddenly that we had not had time to remove any thing from the brig, and all the
                Company's deeds were on board in my desk. Doddrey, however, was in charge of it, and "Worser" was
                fortunately on board with one or two whaling natives.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> We were rather cramped in our elevated bed-room; which was so small that the only
                way of sleeping five in it was to lie across the narrow way, about four feet wide, and double up our
                legs. The violence of the storm, which beat right into the niche, precluded, however, any idea of
                sleeping outside; and we made the best of it.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> In the morning the brig had disappeared; much to our contentment, for we had
                expected to have seen her lying wrecked on the beach. She did not again make the anchorage until the
                13th.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> During this interval we lived in the niche on <i>Moturoa,</i> plentifully fed by
                the natives. "Black Lee," the</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> cook, had a knack of making excellent dishes of pork, potatoes, pumpkins, leeks,
                and fish, of which we got plenty. Then Dicky was never at a loss for a yarn, and kept us all in good
                humour. A clamber to the top of the island two or three times a day to look out for a sail afforded some
                employment; as the path was anything but easy, and the footing on the worn rock rather precarious. About
                half a dozen huts were perched about on different parts of the rock, and caves were hollowed out
                wherever the ground had been soft enough, and neat wooden doors placed to shelter the stores in them.
            </div>
            <div class="jerningham"> We landed twice on the main during these twelve days; but were glad to return to
                the island to sleep, the mosquitoes being in myriads on shore. We did not walk far from the
                landing-place, as the natives had no great store of food on the main, and it was neces- sary to embark
                before the surf should be too heavy for our small canoes.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Dr. Dieffenbach related to us his adventures in two attempts, the first of which
                had been unsuccessful, to reach the summit of Mount Egmont, which he had calculated to be about 9000
                feet above the level of the sea. He had also been along the coast as far as <i>Mokau</i> about halfway
                to <i>Kawia,</i> where he had been received by the natives with primitive hospitality. He has since
                given, in a publication of his own, <a href="#note3" id="note_ref3">
                    <div class="superscript">3</div>
                </a> an interesting journal of these expeditions.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Our monotony was somewhat varied, too, by a fire which destroyed one of the huts on
                the island, and a good deal of native wealth, such as slates, catechisms, and muskets; by the arrival of
                two missionary teachers, liberated slaves, who preached the old story with much vehemence; and by the
                execution of native law in a case of adultery which had taken place on the main.</div>
            <h3>Missionary Hostility.</h3>
            <div class="jerningham"> The conduct of the native teachers caused great indignation in my mind. I began to
                believe that this continued opposition to our proceedings really originated from the White missionaries;
                and being now able to make myself understood pretty well, told the natives my candid opinion of the
                unchristian tendency of these underhand proceedings. But I took care to tell them that the
                <i>rangatira,</i> or "chief" missionaries, would come out with the settlers, and behave very differently
                from those who incited them against us. I also explained to them, that many of these bad missionaries
                were shoemakers or tailors, who received money from people in England to preach the Gospel to them, but
                not to make them enemies to White people; and that the clergymen who were to accompany the settlers
                would preach to them and the White people together in one church.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> It was here, too, that I was first struck with the absurdity of maintaining the
                native language, and the extent to which this was done by the missionaries. Some of the latter, on their
                recent visits, had baptized and christened most of the children, and many of the grown people. They gave
                them English names; but, instead of spelling these names in English and teaching the natives so to
                spell, write, and pronounce them, they taught them to pronounce them in <i>Maori</i> in the way nearest
                approaching to the actual sounds; and then commemorated this adaptation by a printed card, on which the
                transmogrified name appeared, with the date of baptism. Thus "Caroline" was printed "<i>Kararaina;"</i>
                "Edward," "<i>Eruera;"</i> "Charlotte," "<i>Harata;"</i> "Judith," "<i>Urihi</i>;" "Solomon,"
                <i>"Horomona</i>;" "Paul," "<i>Paora."</i> This seemed indeed an advance in order to retrograde: it
                would surely have</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> been preferable to baptize them by <i>native</i> names, if they would not teach
                them the English language. I also observed this straining of a point in order to preserve the native
                language in the missionary translations of the Bible. The <i>Maori</i> language is essentially a poor
                one, and possesses in particular but few words which express abstract ideas. The translators have
                overcome the difficulty by coining words, written according to the <i>Maori</i> pronunciation which
                nearest approaches to the word sought to be represented. All proper names, too, are transformed in the
                native Bible like those given to the natives.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> It must be remembered that the <i>Maori,</i> as made a written language, is
                pronounced in the same way as German or Spanish; that is to say, each vowel has a distinct and
                unalterable sound. No diphthongs, mute vowels, or sounds ending with a consonant, occur in <i>Maori:</i>
                many of our sounds, such as <i>f, s, v, j, l, g, ch, sh, th,</i> are not in the native language, and
                offer considerable difficulty to a <i>Maori;</i> and others which do exist, such as <i>d</i> and
                <i>b,</i> have been banished by the missionaries, and included under <i>r</i> and <i>p.</i> The
                <i>Maori</i> for "angry," for instance, is distinctly pronounced "<i>ridi"</i> by most natives: the
                missionaries, however, disclaim the <i>d,</i> and write it <i>riri.</i> "A hill" is as certainly
                <i>buke;</i> the mis- sionaries write it <i>puke.</i> With the exception of <i>ng,</i> a nasal sound
                peculiar to the language, the natives find it difficult to pronounce two consonants without a vowel
                between them.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> With these explanations, the following table of manufactured words in the
                <i>Maori</i> Bibles and Prayer-books may perhaps be understood: --</div>

                has to be explained to a native. An equal amount of instruction would teach him no inconsiderable part
                of the elements of the language from which the sounds were borrowed.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Thus the comparison of the English and <i>Maori</i> Bibles, in which I passed a
                great portion of the twelve days spent on <i>Moturoa,</i> induced me to believe it most essential that
                the natives should be instructed in the English language as speedily as possible.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> The crime of adultery was most severely punished by <i>Ngamotu,</i> or "the
                Islands," one of the principal chiefs, on his wife. He stripped her naked, and dragged her along the
                beach by the hair of the head, beating her violently at intervals. Nor did any one attempt to interfere;
                the whole body of natives remaining passive spectators of the cruel penalty. The adulterer's house was
                visited by the assembled relations of the wife and husband, who plundered it of everything they could
                lay their hands on, while he offered no resistance, or even remonstrance, according to <i>Maori</i>
                custom. The <i>taua,</i> or "foray," extended to a hut belonging to him on the island, from which
                Barrett's attendants brought mats, flax, and other articles in great glee.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> We had begun to despair of the reappearance of the brig; and thought it extremely
                probable that the disorderly crew had taken possession, and carried her off with her cargo to some other
                country.</div>
            <h3>Return Of The "Guide."</h3>
            <div class="jerningham"> On the 10th, a barque stood in to <i>Motuomahanga,</i> the outer island, and
                lowered a boat. The numerous signals which we made, however, did not attract her notice; and she stood
                on to the northward after the boat had returned on board from a short excursion. This proved afterwards
                to be the Company's surveying-barque Cuba, on her way from Port Nicholson to <i>Kawia.</i></div>
            <div class="jerningham"> On the 13th, we made out another sail to the west-south-west. Barrett launched his
                whale-boat, and we boarded the old Guide about six miles off the islands. She had fortunately left a
                buoy to her first anchor; and to this we fastened her in the evening. On the night of the storm she had
                ridden out the fury of the gale until about four o'clock in the morning, with her last anchor. At that
                time the chain parted close to the ground, and she was in imminent danger. The crew, indeed, loudly
                expressed their intention of picking out a soft place, and running her stem on to the beach.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Fortunately, Doddrey, Worser, and the captain and mate, had prepared themselves for
                this emergency, and had each undertaken a part of the necessary operations for getting her under way.
                The captain himself seized the wheel; the others loosed the sails and paid out the chain; and a
                favourable shift in the wind allowed them to get an offing. Southerly gales outside had driven them as
                far north as the latitude of <i>Kaipara,</i> and prevented them from returning before to-day.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> 14th. --The natives came on board to-day, and after some hesitation on account of a
                desire for more fire-arms, agreed to sign the deed on the morrow.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Feb. 15th. --This morning I took the deed, drawn up like the former ones, ashore.
                Barrett translated it, and explained its provisions. Forty-seven signatures</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> were then appended to it, including the women and the children, whom the chiefs
                compelled to come and touch the pen, as they would be the future chiefs. Two or three young men, who had
                acquired the knowledge of writing, signed their names in full. The others made a cross opposite to their
                names, as had been done on former occasions.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> A party of fifty or sixty natives, who had arrived from a settlement further south,
                now expressed a desire to sell another tract of land adjoining that sold by the <i>Ngamotu</i> chiefs;
                and a large number of them signed a second deed after a short negotiation. The goods were then landed in
                whale-boats through the surf.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> The <i>Ngamotu</i> natives got quietly through the distribution of their share; but
                those from the southward, who were extremely wild and uncouth in their manners and appearance, although
                professing to be strict <i>mihanere,</i> or "missionaries," could not effect it without a scramble. A
                small stream divided the two parties. As soon as the southern party began to show a disposition to
                scramble, one of the chiefs of the <i>Ngamotu</i> tribe raised an exciting shout, and cheered his
                followers on to take advantage of this confusion, in order to partake of the spoil of their neighbours,
                after they had stowed their own away.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> They came rushing on along the hundred yards of beach which separated the two
                parties, flourishing their arms. The readiness with which the others, close to whom I was sitting on a
                sand-hill, dropped their own disagreements and threw themselves into a defensive attitude, was well
                worthy of admiration. Along their own side of the little rill, the most stalwart warriors knelt,
                protruding forward their sharp wooden spears, or grasping the tomahawk firmly, ready to spring upon
            </div>
            <h3>Preparations For A Skirmish.</h3>
            <div class="jerningham"> the assailants. Behind these, others loaded the few guns in their possession, and
                quietly took up a station, while behind them again the women and children handled a weapon as they bent
                over some heaps of goods. And all this in perfect silence; the occasional yells of the charging party
                alone being heard, as they closed rapidly in.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> I was so taken up with admiration at the classical attitudes of some of the
                defenders, who all remained still as statues, gazing stedfastly on the advancing enemy, after they had
                once taken their position, that I had not thought of getting further from the conflict until the moment
                of meeting seemed close at hand. The assailants were all seeking the weakest point as they approached;
                the guns were pointed on both sides; each muscle of the defenders seemed straining with preparation for
                the shock; and I suddenly thought of my own dangerous position, and flung myself flat on the ground,
                expecting to hear a volley and the whistling of bullets over my head.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Barrett, however, had tripped up one of the assailants and pinioned another at this
                critical moment; Worser and the women of his train had also suddenly rushed between the threatening
                ranks of their relations; and after some squabbling and earnest persuasion of the most refractory, peace
                was re-established. The <i>Ngamotu</i> seemed to treat the affair as a mere joke; but the others were
                more than suspicious, and, sullenly packing their goods on the backs of the women and slaves, departed
                homewards at nightfall, without the usual farewell. A strong party of vigilant warriors closed the rear
                of the caravan as it crossed the sand-hills inland of <i>Paretutu.</i></div>
            <div class="jerningham"> The two purchases extended from a spot half-way between the mouth of the
                <i>Mokau</i> river and the Sugar-</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> loaf Islands, to a river called <i>Wangatawa,</i> south of Cape Egmont; and inland,
                to the summit of the mountain, and thence to a spot on the banks of the <i>Wanganui</i> river, high up
                its course. Had we been provided with a handier vessel and good crew, we should have proceeded to extend
                the transaction by treaties at <i>Mokau,</i> and at <i>Patea</i> between Cape Egmont and
                <i>Wanganui;</i> the chiefs of those places having been prepared for such an arrangement by deputations
                which had travelled to <i>Ngamotu</i> in order to treat with Barrett during our absence. We were forced,
                however, by the inferior sailing-qualities and appointments of the Guide, to renounce these expeditions
                on a dangerous lee-shore; and turned her head towards Port Nicholson on the evening of the 16th. The
                whole menagerie from <i>Moturoa</i> was transferred on board; three <i>Mokau</i> chiefs accompanied us,
                in order to urge upon Colonel Wakefield the purchase of their country; and we bade farewell to our
                friends at "the Islands," promising that they should soon have <i>pakeha</i> to live amongst them.</div>
        </div>
        <h3>Barracoota Fishing.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> We met a south-easter at the mouth of the Strait, and were detained by that and a calm
            until the night of the 19th. During the calm, Worser amused us by an exhibition of his skill in catching
            <i>manga,</i> or barracoota. This is a long fish without scales, exceedingly voracious, and generally found
            in shoals, like the <i>kawai.</i> The presence of either of these fish is easily detected in a calm, when
            the shoals rush along the surface of the water at intervals, marking it like what sailors call a
            <i>cat's-paw,</i> or breath of light wind. A <i>school,</i> as Worser styled it, having appeared, he fitted
            his machinery, and slung himself in the main-chains. At the end of a stick three or four feet long, which he
            held in his hand, there was fastened, by some three feet of strong line, a piece of red wood four inches
            long, two broad, and one thick. Through the end of the wood a common nail was driven, and turned back so as
            to form a rude hook. On the approach of the shoal, Worser thrashed the water within his reach with the bit
            of wood and the end of his rod, whirling it round with great speed. The <i>manga</i> soon leapt out of
            water, disputing with each other for the wooden bait. Dozens were darting at one time at the hook. When one
            was hooked, a dexterous heave flung him on the deck with centrifugal force, and the hook again thrashed the
            water. This way of angling requires much experience and quickness of hand. Worser, who was a renowned
            fisherman in all ways, caught upwards of a dozen fine fish in the few minutes during which the shoal
            remained near us.</div>
        <div class="simon">
            <p>This technique of barracuda fishing is actually a traditional Māori technique, which Jerningham is
                describing quite accurately. The technique appears to be unique to Māori, and exclusively used for
                barracuda. That Worser has become expert in the technique is a testament to the length of time he has
                spent living among Māori.</p>
            <p>"Worser" is James "Worser" Heberley, a whaler and later a pilot for Wellington harbour. Like many of the
                so called "Pākehā-Māori" of early New Zealand, he'd lived an adventurous life, fighting in battles
                alongside Te Rauparaha and fleeing the inevitable reprisals. His nickname, which is now given to the bay
                which became his home in Wellington, comes either from his habit of predicting that the weather would
                become "worser", or is a corruption of the Te Reo Māori "whata", after the store-house he was forced to
                live in until he could build his own house.</p>
            <p>He is pictured here some time in the 1870s with his first wife, Te Wai Nahi, a prominent Te Āti Awa
                woman.</p><img src="images/worser.jpg" class="inset"

        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Just as it fell dark on the 20th, we rounded Cape <i>Terawiti,</i> with a freshening
            breeze from north-west. The skipper got very nervous when the squalls came whistling off the high land about
            Sinclair Head; and, ignorant of this coast, seemed to dread the long lines of black reefs with which it is
            fringed. We all, however, supported Dicky Barrett in his earnest declarations that it was necessary to carry
            on; and made all sail to windward. A fine moon, peeping every now and then through the driving scud, lighted
            us on our way; and by daylight on the 21st we were beating up within Port Nicholson, close to Somes's
            Island.</div>
