        <h2> CHAPTER IV.</h2>
        <h3>Warepori And Epuni.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> THE coast now forms a semicircular bay, at the northeast end of
            which is the mouth of Port Nicholson. A low table-land jutting out into a headland which
            we christened Baring Head, and the bluff end of a ridge called <i>Turakirai,</i> which
            divides Port Nicholson from Palliser Bay, form the eastern side of the semicircle. The
            western side slopes down from Sinclair Head into bare hills of moderate height, which,
            with a hilly fern-covered peninsula, form the western head of the harbour. The cove, at
            the head of which is the low sandy isthmus joining the peninsula to the main, might be
            mistaken by an inexperienced person for the real entrance. Piloted, however, by Dicky
            Barrett, we soon opened out the true channel, which lies between a two-headed bluff now
            called Pencarrow Head, a mile inside of Baring Head, and the peninsula. A reef of low
            black rocks is situated about mid-channel; and this seemed, as we approached from the
            westward, to close the passage. We found it, however, a mile in width between the reef
            and Pencarrow Head, and beat in against a good working breeze. Two islands inside the
            harbour formed distinguishing marks.</div>

        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Captain Cook once anchored in the entrance of this magnificent
            harbour. Being anxious to rejoin the other ship in company with him, he was unable to
            examine it, but spoke highly of its promising appearance as a port.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> It was christened Port Nicholson by the captain of a Sydney trading
            vessel some years ago, after his patron and friend the harbour-master of Port Jackson,
            in New South Wales.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> As we advanced up the channel, which continues from two to three
            miles in width for four miles from a little inside the reef, we were boarded by two
            canoes, containing the two principal chiefs of the tribe living on shore. One of mature
            years, named <i>Epuni,</i> or "Greedy," advanced with much dignity of manner to greet
            Barrett as an old and respected friend, and was joined in this by his nephew
            <i>Warepori,</i> or "Dark House," a fine commanding man of about thirty-five. They were
            both nearly related to Mrs. Barrett, and had been Dicky's companions in the dangerous
            wars of <i>Taranaki.</i> The old man, Barrett told us, was as famous for his wisdom in
            council as for his former deeds of war. <i>Warepori</i> exercised the more immediate
            direction of the tribe, having acquired a more modern reputation by recent warlike
            exploits, by his attractive eloquence, and by his perfection in the native
            accomplishments of canoe and house making, clearing, and marshalling his followers in
            the field.</div>
        <div class="simon">
            <p>I'm not sure where Jerningham gets "greedy" from for "Epuni", but it's not really
                relevant anyway, since the guy's full name is actually "Te Puni-kōkopu" which he
                earned during a daring escape from a besieged pā. He jumped off a cliff into the
                Waiwhakaiho River and swam to safety. "Puni" means "deep pool" and "kōkopu" is a
                fresh-water fish. It's Jerningham's mistaken "Epuni" which gives the name to the
                Lower Hutt suburb though.</p>
            <p>We can rule out Jerningham's poor translation as being another of his slights against
                an enemy because as we'll see throughout the book, Jerningham takes every
                opportunity to praise Te Puni (he's already started with that "much dignity of
                manner" line). This is because Te Puni will become a staunch ally of the New Zealand
                Company, one of the few Māori leaders to do so. His younger cousin Te Wharepōuri has
                a more troubled relationship with the Wakefields, and consequently suffers in
                Jerningham's portrayal. (<a

                    Ara</a>)</p>
            <img class="inset" src="images/te_puni.jpg"
                title="Angela Ballara. 'Te Puni-kōkopu, Hōniana', Dictionary of New Zealand Biography, first published in 1990. Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1t58/te-puni-kokopu-honiana (accessed 15 February 2021)">
            <p>Heaphy's portrait doesn't convey much personality, nor does it show that Te Puni is
                already about 60 years old. Both Te Puni and Wharepōuri have travelled to Sydney for
                trade and are quite familiar with Europeans.</p>
            <p>The two Te Āti Awa leaders have their reasons for being solicitous of allies. As they
                meet with the <i>Tory</i>, they're in a very delicate political situation. Though
                they were allies of Te Rauparaha in the migration from Taranaki, their relationship
                has since deteriorated. They're warring with another of Te Rauparaha's allied
                tribes, Ngāti Raukawa (Jerningham calls them the "boiling-water" tribe, possibly a
                reference to their lands around Taupo), as well as those Ngāti Mutunga who had not
                left for the Chatham Islands.</p>
            <p>Having a new settlement of Europeans in their vicinity will solve a lot of problems
                for Te Āti Awa. The money that inevitably accompanies trade with Europeans will help
                them buy muskets to defend themselves, and just the presence of Europeans tends to
                discourage violence - everyone is painfully aware of events like the <i>Harriet</i>
                affair, and the swift and indiscriminate retribution that sometimes befalls those
                who harm the new settlers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> The harbour expanded as we advanced, two deep bays stretching to
            the south-west from the innermost end of the entering channel. From their western
            extremity the land trends round to a valley lying at the northern end of the harbour,
            about eight miles from the reef, while the hilly shores of the eastern side continue
            nearly straight to the mouth of the valley; thus leaving the upper part of the great
            basin four or five miles in width. In this upper part lie the two islands, behind the
            largest and most northerly of which we anchored at the distance of half-a-mile from the
            sandy beach at the valley's mouth. <i>Epuni</i> eagerly inquired the motive of our
            visit, and expressed the most marked satisfaction on hearing that we wished to buy the
            place, and bring white people to it. <i>Warepori</i> also expressed his willingness to
            sell the land, and his desire of seeing white men come to live upon it.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> When the followers of <i>Epuni</i> and <i>Warepori</i> formed part
            of the extensive migration from <i>Taranaki</i> about the year 1834, they found this
            district occupied by the <i>Ngatimutunga,</i> who had been allied with <i>Rauperaha</i>
            during his invasion and conquest of the Strait. Tired, however, by the constant
            incursions of the <i>Ngatikahuhunu,</i> the tribe who had been driven by them to the
            east coast, but not exterminated, the <i>Ngatimutunga</i> determined to seek a new
            location. They partly forced and partly paid the captain of an English vessel to carry
            them to the Chatham Islands, which they conquered and occupied. Before they departed,
            <i>E Mare,</i> their head chief, formally ceded the place to <i>Warepori</i> in exchange
            for some clubs of green-stone or <i>meri ponamu.</i> The <i>Ngatiawa</i> had since that
            period been much harassed by parties of the old occupants, and also by invasions from
            <i>Rauperaha's</i> "boiling-water" allies, who had sometimes come overland down the
            northern valley which I have noticed.</div>
        <h3>Missionary Notions.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> The two chiefs passed the night on board. They told us that the
            schooner of which we had heard had left some native missionary teachers, and that, in
            compliance with Mr. Williams's instructions, they had built houses and chapels in
            readiness for his arrival. They then discussed the merits of the missionary labours.
            They acknowledged that they would be heartily glad to renounce war and cannibalism, but
            deprecated the incessant praying and singing, which the younger chief especially
            objected to, as taking the people from their industrious avocations, and substituting a
            monotonous repetition, which lasted all day and night, for activity in cultivating their
            potato-grounds or hollowing out canoes. "We want," said they, "to live in peace, and to
            have white people come amongst us. We are growing old, and want our children to have
            protectors in people from Europe. We do not want the missionaries from the Bay of
            Islands: they are <i>pakeha maori,</i> or 'whites who have become natives,' We have long
            heard of ships from Europe. Here is one at length; and we will sell our harbour and
            land, and live with the white people when they come to us." </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>Epuni</i> also asked us to explain what the missionaries meant
            by saying, "that all the white men not missionaries were <i>devils."</i></div>
        <div class="simon">
            <p>Sure. Sure Jerningham. That's exactly what they said.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> September 21st. --In the morning the two chiefs renewed the
            conversation about the land; and told Colonel Wakefield to go and look at the land, and
            see how he liked it. They did not wish to talk any more about it until this had been
            done; and <i>Warepori</i> said he should go and finish a large canoe which he was
            working at, and that in two or three days he should have done, and my uncle would know
            whether the land was good. A chief named <i>Amahau</i> was appointed to take him up the
            river which flows through the valley of which I have spoken; and they started, with
            Barrett and some natives, in a small canoe.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Several of us landed at a large village opposite our anchorage, and
            witnessed the ceremony of crying over <i>E Rangi,</i> whom many of her numerous
            relations had not seen for live years. The village lay, as its <i>maori</i> name
            (<i>Pitone,</i> or "End of the Sand") implied, at the western end of the sandy beach,
            which is about two miles long. The main river falls into the sea at the eastern end,
            about a quarter of a mile from the hills which bound the valley to the east, and is
            called the <i>Heretaonga.</i> A merry brawling stream, called the <i>Korokoro,</i> or
            "throat," flows between the village and the western hills. The valley seems to preserve
            an average width of two miles to a considerable distance, bounded on either side by
            wooded hills from 300 to 400 feet in height. It was covered with high forest to within a
            mile and a half of the beach, when swamps full of flax, and a belt of sand-hummocks,
            intervened.</div>
        <h3>Tangi, Or Crying--Nayti.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> The <i>tangi,</i> or crying, continued for a long period. The
            resident natives raised the most discordant whining lamentations, streaming at the eyes,
            nose, and mouth, and lacerating every part of their bodies with sharp cockle-shells
            until the blood flowed. This was done, however, with considerable regularity and
            attention, so as to leave scars rather ornamental than otherwise after the affair was
            over. Those who wish to commemorate one of these scenes of mourning or rejoicing (for
            the ceremonies and native word are precisely the same in both cases), apply a black dye
            to the scar, and thus retain a sort of slight <i>tatu.</i></div>
        <div class="simon">
            <p>Here's a quote from Professor Ngahuia Te Awekotuku describing this practice.</p>
            <div style="margin-left: 2em;">
                <p>"Haehae was a more primal form of modifying the body, including the face, in
                    response to grief and death. Unlike ta moko, which was an erudite art form
                    applied by an expert tohunga with chisels and pigment, haehae was a spontaneous
                    expression of intense grief. Inflicted with tuhua, or obsidian flakes, sharp
                    mata or whaiapu stone, or razor shells; you did this to yourself. It was not
                    seen as mutilation, as self harm; it was a visceral compulsion, still occurring
                    today, but usually misread and misunderstood in modern times. Many waiata tangi,
                    or songs of lamentation, allude to this practice as a vivid demonstration of
                    loss. More females than males tended to do this, yet men also engaged in
                    haehae." (Memento Mori: Memento Maori – moko and memory, Ngahuia Te Awekotuku
                    2009) </p>
            </div>
            <p>She only describes this in connection to grief, not to rejoicing, which makes me
                wonder if Jerningham has misunderstood the significance of the ceremonies he saw.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> The native visitors from <i>Te-awa-iti,</i> who had acquired to a
            considerable degree civilized ways of greeting one another, seemed anything but
            comfortable while the ceremony lasted. They had forgotten the art of producing tears at
            will, and had a decided objection to spoiling their fine clothes, donned for the
            occasion, by any blood-letting. They therefore hung down their heads and looked
            wretched, patiently waiting for the moment when native etiquette would allow them to
            laugh and be cheerful, and exchange the important news from either side of the Strait.
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> We started with a native guide to look for pigeons, strongly
            impressed with the wish of escaping to a respectful distance from the melodious
            greeting.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Along the foot of the western hills we passed through numerous
            flourishing potato-gardens, and were greeted and stared at by those at work in them, who
            eagerly collected all the news from our guides. We found abundance of pigeons, and
            returned laden to the <i>pa.</i> The <i>tangi</i> had terminated; the <i>umu,</i> or
            "cooking-holes," were smoking away for the feast; and eager groups of inquisitive faces
            were gathered round the proud narrators of our doings in Queen Charlotte's Sound. Our
            friend Jim Crow found many old friends and relations at <i>Pitone,</i> and his audience
            was by no means the least numerous or attentive. Nothing can remind one more forcibly of
            the monkey who had seen the world, than a <i>maori</i> thus relating news. He is an
            incorrigible exaggerator, and swells each minute circumstance into an affair of state,
            taking delight in drawing repeated exclamations of amazement from the surrounding
            <i>badauds,</i> who admire and envy the red night-cap or trowsers with which he may be
            adorned, with quite as much zeal as they drink in his metaphors and amplifications.
        </div>
        <h3>Nayti--Natives.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>Nayti,</i> who belonged to a different tribe, the <i>Kawia,</i>
            had not yet had much opportunity of indulging in this universal propensity; he seemed
            shy and reserved among these people, and they appeared to regard him with more suspicion
            than respect.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>Enai,</i> the <i>Kawia</i> chief, had taken great pains to
            depreciate him in our estimation when we were at Port Gore, by saying that he was no
            chief, and that his name was not Nayti, but <i>Eriki Nono,</i> a term, when translated,
            expressive of some contempt. We attributed a good deal of this to <i>Enai's</i> envy of
            Nayti for possessing so many fine things. Nayti, however, who had confirmed us in our
            supposition that the name <i>Eriki,</i> applied to him constantly by the Ship Cove and
            <i>Te-awa-iti</i> people, signified "chief," now allowed it to be only a corruption of
            Dicky, by which name he had served, when a boy, in whale-boats at Cloudy Bay. We also
            discovered that he was not so well related as he had stated in England, but that the
            great attention paid to him by people of the highest classes there had very naturally
            induced him to give a tacit consent to the term "chief" or "prince," by which they often
            designated him: we therefore attached no blame to him for this assumption. The confused
            idea which the natives have of relationship, too, had assisted in causing him to make
            this mistake. A native will often state another man to be his <i>tuakana,</i> or "elder"
            brother, meaning only that he is of an elder branch of the same family. In like manner,
            <i>matua,</i> or "parent," implies no direct parentage, but often indicates only a
            slight relationship of a person of the older generation in the same family. Nayti had
            told us of his numerous brothers and sisters, having in fact neither one nor the other,
            but meaning cousins in various degrees.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> We found one solitary white man, named Joe Robinson, living in a
            village near the mouth of the river, having taken a native wife from the tribe. We saw a
            proof of his industry and ingenuity in the shape of a boat, the planks for which he had
            cut with a hand-saw; and he had made all the nails himself out of iron hoop. This boat
            earned many a pound in later times by trading round the coast.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Colonel Wakefield returned on board in the evening, having ascended
            the main branch of the river until some snags prevented the further progress of the
            canoe. He described the banks as of the richest soil, and covered with majestic timber,
            except where fertile but scanty gardens had been cleared and cultivated by the natives.
            He found some fifty people at work there, who had concealed themselves in the bush the
            day before on hearing our guns when we saluted the New Zealand flag as we anchored. They
            greeted him on his ascent, and presented him with potatoes cooked in readiness on his
            return. At one spot they inquired of the guide whether the White men in the ship were
            missionaries. Upon his answering that they were all <i>devils,</i> "shouts of laughter,"
            Colonel Wakefield afterwards wrote, "betrayed their acquaintance with his allusion," and
            their opinion of the uncharitable tenet which had "given rise to it." </div>
        <div class="simon">
            <p>The "New Zealand Flag" is what is now usually called the "United Tribes" flag. This
                picture shows the flag actually raised in Petone by the New Zealand Company. </p>
            <img class="inset" src="images/nz_flag.jpg"
                title="https://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/object/62255">
            <p>The Company had their own reasons for asserting the relevance of this flag over the
                British Union Jack. If New Zealand is an independent territory, then their only
                legal responsibility is to those Māori chiefs who are sovereign in New Zealand. But
                if New Zealand is British territory, then they are subject to British law, and their
                land-buying expedition is of dubious legality.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> September 22nd, Sunday. --The breeze of yesterday had increased
            into a gale, and blew with great violence from north-west. The ship, however, was not
            affected by it. Several canoes came off with natives, to be present at our Church
            service. One of them, a low skimming-dish thing without topside planks, filled and
            turned over, ducking six or seven natives, including a woman, who were passengers. They
            seemed to be perfectly used to such accidents, and some hung on to the bottom of the
            canoe while the others swam with one hand and gathered the paddles which had gone
            adrift. One of our boats soon rescued them, and they were furnished with dry blankets
            and sent to warm themselves at the galley.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> In the evening a messenger arrived from abreast of <i>Kapiti,</i>
            with the news that a fight might be expected; the "Boiling-water" tribe having mustered
            in great strength near to that place, and being set on by <i>Rauperaha</i> to attack the
            <i>Ngatiawa</i> along the intervening coast. As there seemed some probability that this
            invasion might reach Port Nicholson, the natives one and all went ashore in defiance of
            the gale to gather the particulars and consult on measures of defence.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> 23rd. --I accompanied Colonel Wakefield and Barrett in an excursion
            to the different settlements round the harbour. At one about half-way along the west
            shore, called <i>Nga Hauranga,</i> we found <i>Warepori</i> at work with an adze on a
            large canoe. The bottom of this vessel consisted of a single tree hollowed out, and was
            sixty feet long. The long planks to be added on to the sides were placed between pegs
            stuck into the ground so as to give them the requisite curvature. We had not been there
            long before two large canoes from the southern end of the harbour put in at his call.
            They were on their way to <i>Pitone,</i> whither two chiefs were going in order to
            discuss the sale of the land. When they had landed, there were about sixty men
            assembled, and they proceeded to hold a <i>korero</i> or "talk," on the all-important
            subject, while the women prepared a feast in the native ovens, and the children gathered
            round us to examine our clothes and other equipments, and to stare at our white faces.
        </div>
        <h3>Speeches On Sale Of Land.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>Warepori</i> put aside his adze, and introduced the matter
            shortly, saying that this white man (Colonel Wakefield) had come to buy all their land
            and give them white people to befriend them</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> A chief named <i>Puakawa,</i> or "Bitter Milk-thistle," <button
                class="inline" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#info1"
                aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="info1">i</button>
            <div id="info1" class="info collapse width">
                <p>Other sources identify this man as Waiwhetu chief Wiremu Puwhakaawe, who will
                    shortly meet an untimely end.</p>
                <p>The plant "Bitter milk-thistle" is nowadays called "puha" in New Zealand.</p>
            </div> now rose, and opposed the intended sale with great energy. He objected to it on
            the score of the bad treatment which he urged might be expected from the White settlers,
            and represented the folly of parting with the new home of which they had acquired so
            good and secure possession after the long sufferings and dangers of their migration. He
            spoke for an hour, most vigorously, and with admirable emphasis and gesticulation.
            Although I did not then know enough of the language to understand all his words, and
            only gathered the substance from Barrett at each pause, his expression and action
            sufficiently explained the spirit and sense of his oration. An old sage named
            <i>Matangi</i> now rose and favoured the sale. He was once the most influential chief of
            the tribe, and was a near relation of <i>Warepori'</i>s father. His extreme old age and
            consequent physical debility had impaired his influence, but his experience and
            venerable dignity still gave great weight to his words. His silver-white hair and long
            beard, and benignant countenance, gave him the air of a Priam or a Nestor, and he almost
            wept for joy when he dwelt on the prospect of white people coming to protect his
            grandchildren against their enemies.
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>Warepori</i> followed in the same strain; talking, however,
            about himself a great deal. He said that he was known in Europe, and that the ship had
            been sent to him. This is the usual habit of a powerful chief, who always seizes upon
            any opportunity of maintaining his personal consequence among his people. No native ever
            "bounces," as it is called by the whalers, at one of these public <i>korero,</i> unless
            he is confident that no other member of the tribe dare contradict or ridicule his
            assumption. The perfect silence maintained during <i>Warepori's</i> somewhat bombastic
            speech, proved to how great an extent he might rely upon his authority. He was left,
            however, with no audience but the leader of the opposition, <i>Puakawa,</i> as soon as
            the cooks displayed their bill of fare. We also partook of the meal, having assigned to
            us two or three newly made baskets-ful of birds and potatoes cooked deliciously. The
            <i>maori "umu,"</i> or cooking-hole, is a very complete steaming apparatus, and is used
            as follows. In a hole scraped in the ground, about three feet in diameter and one foot
            deep, a wood fire is first lighted. Round stones, about the size of a man's fist, are
            heaped upon the faggots, and fall among the ashes as the fire consumes the wood. When
            they are thus nearly red-hot, the cook picks out any pieces of charcoal that may appear
            above the stones, turns all the stones round with two sticks, and arranges them so as to
            afford a pretty uniform heat and surface. She then sprinkles water on the stones from a
            dried gourd of which the inside has been hollowed, and a copious steam rises. Clean
            grass, milk-thistle, or wild turnip leaves, dipped in water, are laid on the stones; the
            potatoes, which have been carefully scraped of their peel with cockle-shells, and
            washed, are placed on the herbs, together with any birds, meat, or fish that may be
            included in the mess; fresh herbs are laid over the food, flax baskets follow,
            completely covering the heap, and the masses then buried with the earth from the hole.
            No visible steam escapes from the apparatus, which looks like a large mole-hill; and
            when the old hags, who know how to time the cookery with great accuracy from constant
            practice, open the catacomb, everything is sure to be found thoroughly and equally
            cooked.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> The little birds were chiefly the <i>tui</i> or mocking-bird. This
            bird has been often described. It resembles a blackbird in size and plumage, with two
            graceful bunches of white feathers under the neck. It abounds in the woods, and is
            remarkably noisy and active. Its most common note is a mixture of two or three graduated
            notes on a flute, a sneeze, and a sharp whistle; but it imitates almost every feathered
            inhabitant of the forest, and, when domesticated, every noise it hears. It is of a
            particularly sweet flavour, and very tender.<button class="inline"

        </div>
        <h3>Discussions.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> We were struck, during the discussion above-mentioned, with the
            natural dignity and becoming regularity with which the deliberations were carried on.
            With the exception of an occasional exclamation of "<i>korero! korero!" "</i>speak!
            speak!" which was used like our "hear! hear!" in either an encouraging or an ironical
            sense, or an earnest but low expression of approval or dissent, no interruption of the
            orators ever took place; nor was there any contention as to the order in which the
            different chiefs should speak. Even while <i>Warepori</i> was employing each of his feet
            to rub off the other a cloud of small, troublesome sand-flies which annoyed him while he
            was speaking, not a smile was to be observed even among the children. No consulting
            among themselves took place; each speaker seemed to have come with his words prepared,
            or to rely on his own capacity for expressing the ideas of the moment or meeting
            unexpected arguments. <i>Puakawa,</i> although far from convinced, seemed to acquiesce
            partly in the general decision adopted in favour of the sale, and moved off with the
            rest of the travelling orators to <i>Pitone,</i> where a similar discussion was to take
            place. We took the remains of our meal with us into the boat, and visited one or two
            settlements at the southern end of the harbour before we returned on board. It is
            absolutely requisite, in order to comply with the forms of <i>Maori</i> etiquette, for
            the guest to take away his dish and all that he has not eaten. It would give lasting
            offence to leave on the spot any part of what is set before him. A compliance with this
            custom would cause some astonishment at a large London banquet.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> 24th. --The discussion was renewed at <i>Pitone</i> today; many
            chiefs being present from the other settlements. It ended, as yesterday, in the thorough
            approval of the measure by a very large majority; <i>Puakawa</i> and a few adherents
            still looking with a doubting eye upon the transaction. When the speeches were
            concluded, and the whole nature of the proposed transaction, including the provision for
            the Native Reserves, had been explained to them, Col. Wakefield asked the chiefs,
            through Barrett, whether they had made up their minds? They asked in return, "Have you
            seen the place? how do you like it?" He answered that he had seen it sufficiently, and
            that it was good: upon which they replied, that it would be for him now to speak, as
            they had decided upon selling their lands on their own judgment, aided by the advice of
            their people in the neighbourhood. They referred to <i>Puakawa</i> and his people, who
            were the only dissenters, and said that they had but little right to speak about the
            land, and had shown no solid argument against its sale. Their chief one had been that
            the white people would drive the natives away, as they had done at Port Jackson; and
            this the others over-ruled by adducing the Native Reserves, and saying that they would
            live with the Englishmen as with each other.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> After the serious discussion had closed, some of the warlike chiefs
            amused us and themselves by sham-fighting, and their exercise with the spear and
            tomahawk. One, named <i>Kaihaia,</i> diverted us much by his active menacing gestures
            and hideous grimaces of defiance, leaping about like a monkey, and bringing a long
            pointed wooden spear within an inch of our bodies; then retreating with a roar of
            laughter every time he saw us shrink from the thrust. He is nicknamed <i>Taringa
                kuri,</i> or "Dogs-ear," and professed great hatred for <i>Rauperaha,</i> whose name
            he frequently shouted out as he brandished his hatchet against thin air. I repaid him
            his surprise the first day that he came on board. I had got an accordion under a large
            cloak, and kept time to its notes with my mouth, so as to deceive him and twenty other
            natives into the idea that I was uttering the various sounds. They showed a profound
            respect for my oratorical talents, until I let them find out the trick, a day or two
            after. The accordion in question was called my mouth for a long time afterwards.</div>
        <div class="simon">
            <p>"Kaihaia" is Te Kaeaea, a Ngāti Tama chief. He has good reason to hate Te Rauparaha,
                as Ngāti Tama has spent the last five years or so scrapping with him and his allies.
                His nickname, "Taringakurī" was in fact given to him by Te Rauparaha's ally Te
                Rangihaeata, in reference to his obstinancy in continuing the feud. (<a
                    href="https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1t38/te-kaeaea">Te Ara</a>)</p>
            <p>Te Kaeaea will become one of the principal opponents of the settlement in Wellington.

        </div>
        <h3>The Purchase.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> 25th. -- This morning, the goods which Colonel Wakefield intended
            to give the natives for their land were got upon deck, in the presence of about a
            hundred of the natives. Except incessant chattering, they offered no obstruction or
            inconvenience to this process; but as they filled up a good deal of room on deck, which
            was wanted in order to assort the various things, my uncle requested <i>Warepori</i> to
            explain this and get them to go ashore until all was ready. He instantly addressed them
            from the hurricane-house, and set the example of going on shore himself, which was
            readily and expeditiously followed by all. </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> On the 26th, when all the articles had been selected and arranged,
            a message was sent on shore for all the chiefs, who came accompanied by their sons. They
            examined the stock of goods strictly and carefully, and approved of the quality and
            quantity. They seemed, however, embarrassed as to the distribution among the six minor
            tribes of which the population was composed. It was therefore proposed to them to divide
            the lots on our deck. Colonel Wakefield also sent for the principal native missionary
            teacher, a young man who had been christened Richard Davis, after his master and patron
            at the Bay of Islands, and who had arrived in the missionary schooner mentioned
            formerly. It was hoped that his presence as a witness to the transaction might give it
            weight and force; but on his arrival, we found him so importunate for presents to
            himself, and so totally devoid of influence or authority among the chiefs, that we did
            not regret his returning to tend a sick child at home. </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> A very ample and liberal compensation, according to the number of
            native inhabitants and the standard of value assigned to land in all former purchases,
            had been appointed by Colonel Wakefield. As he was resolved, however, to distinguish
            this purchase by a freedom from that haggling and over-reaching spirit which we had
            ascertained to have characterized all former dealings with the New Zealanders, he
            informed them through Barrett, that he should show them at once what he intended to
            give, and that he would suffer no bargaining for more or less.</div>
        <h3>Opposition.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> It was plainly, however, contrary to the custom of the <i>Maori</i>
            to dispose of so important an affair without plenty of talking; so they debated in due
            form as to the course to be adopted in distributing the goods; and <i>Warepori,</i> as
            he had been repeatedly urged by us, used his best endeavours to prevent the occurrence
            of one of those fierce and sometimes fatal scrambles which Barrett and the other white
            men told us were the universal consequence of a large present of goods to any of these
            tribes. He entreated the different chiefs to exert their influence towards preventing
            such an event when our boats should land the goods at the different settlements. Some of
            them seemed half inclined to protest against this reform of their customary habits, and
            appeared to look forward with some interest to the excitement of a scramble, in which
            they knew that personal prowess obtained the better share. <i>Puakawa</i> took advantage
            of this slight difference of opinion to address another violent harangue to the
            assemblage, dissuasive of the whole measure. He seemed most earnest and wilful in his
            opposition, and used the energetic action suited to his words. His attentive audience
            cried "<i>korero! korero!"</i> as on shore; and seemed to humour his love of
            contradiction while they differed from him in opinion.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> After enumerating the articles of which the payment consisted, he
            described with great vivacity the rush which would be sure to take place for them on
            shore, and dwelt upon the fact that there would not be enough of everything to go round
            among all, and that many would remain dissatisfied. He said that everyone had cleared a
            bit of land, and that many would find themselves deprived of that, and without anything
            in exchange. "What will you say," urged he, "when you find that you have parted with all
            your land from the <i>Rimarapa</i> to the <i>Turakirai,</i> and from the <i>Tararua</i>
            to the sea?"</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> These were the boundaries which had been pointed out by
            <i>Warepori</i> from the deck in the hearing of the assembled chieftains. He had
            followed with his finger the summit of the mountain ranges mentioned, and told me their
            names, in order to their insertion in the deed, which I had been employed in preparing
            in the course of the day. <i>Tararua</i> is the name of a high snowy range, at the head
            of the great valley, from which the two other ranges branch off to the sea.</div>

            <h3>No Title But Occupancy.</h3>
            <div class="jerningham"> It was extremely difficult--nay almost impossible--to buy a
                large and distinct tract of land, with fixed boundaries, from any native or body of
                natives of this part of New Zealand, perfectly unused as they were to any dealing in
                land according to our notions. These people had no distinct boundaries marked when
                they received the cession from the <i>Ngatimutunga,</i> and would have been puzzled
                to walk round or point out accurately any particular limit between the waste land
                under their jurisdiction and that at the disposal of another tribe. The <i>Kawia</i>
                tribe, indeed, laid a claim to this whole neighbourhood, also without exact
                boundaries. The <i>Ngatiawa</i> chiefs knew that they had a right to occupy any
                portion of the land near Port Nicholson, because <i>E Mare</i> had told them to do
                so, and because they maintained by their own gallantry and strength their right to
                clear new patches where they pleased and to live unejected by their enemies. But
                they knew not of any further right to a district covered with primaeval forest, far
                too vast for the use of any descendants of their tribe whom they could look forward
                to, and likely, as far as they thought, to remain both unvisited and useless for
                ages to come. No hunting ever led to disputes concerning limits in the forest, there
                being no beasts to hunt; and the only disputes respecting land which had yet
                occurred between the natives themselves arose from the invasion of lands already
                cleared or likely to be wanted soon, or the taking of trees from a forest already
                marked out by another savage for a supply of canoes or house-timber. The first
                clearer became the acknowledged owner of a tract of hitherto intact land: the first
                axeman in a primaeval forest laid claim to the surrounding trees. But a claim to
                waste land beyond this natural one of seizure and occupancy was unknown among them
                at this time. It may be safely asserted that <i>Warepori</i> considered himself to
                be making over to Colonel Wakefield this vague right deduced from proximity,
                together with that over the more actual possessions of the tribe near the sea, when
                he pointed with his finger along a line of hills forming the horizon of sight all
                round, on which he had probably never been, and concerning which he could have no
                certain knowledge whether they were inhabited or not by other owners. And he had
                acquired the idea of ownership to this wild and desert district by the wish which we
                had expressed, of paying a larger sum than he had yet seen for a larger tract of
                land than any for which he had yet heard treated, in order to receive a population
                beyond his imagination of numbers, and to be made available with a rapidity beyond
                what he could conceive. It was probably the first time that he had thought of the
                boundaries to the waste land over which he claimed dominion; and the haughty way in
                which he pointed out, on being asked the question for the first time, that he was
                "monarch of all he surveyed," had some affinity to his former assumption that the
                first ship he had ever seen from Europe was come out expressly to him. They were
                both rapid adoptions of new ideas, which our suggestions and offers of a new state
                of things induced him to seize and confirm.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Colonel Wakefield was accordingly obliged to buy of the
                natives, not certain lands within certain boundaries, but the rights, claims, and
                interests of the contracting chieftains, whatsoever they might be, to any land
                whatever within certain boundaries. Such were the terms of all the deeds afterwards
                executed, and such were the terms of the Company's purchases as explained fully to
                the chiefs themselves. </div>
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> "What will you say," continued <i>Puakawa,</i> "when many, many
            White men come here, and drive you all away into the mountains? How will you feel when
            you go to the White man's house or ship to beg for shelter and hospitality, and he tells
            you, with his eyes turned up to heaven, and the name of his God in his mouth, to be
            gone, for that your land is paid for?"</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> I was sensibly affected by his earnest depiction of this scene, and
            the sincerity which his face reflected as he held up so discouraging a prospect to his
            fellow men; and when Barrett had interpreted his words, I glowed with pleasure at the
            thought that the day would come when he would recognize that there were White men
            different from those he had yet seen, who would make use of their superiority, and even
            their legal right, only to afford the most extended hospitality and kindness to such as
            himself, and to raise him up to a level with themselves.</div>
        <div class="simon">
            <p>It's a testament to Jerningham's complete lack of a sense of irony that he can
                bald-facedly include this paragraph in the same book which will also describe
                Puwhakaawe's fears coming exactly true.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> These long and repeated discussions were most interesting and
            satisfactory; as they proved how thoroughly the most dissentient natives understood the
            force of the transaction, and how gratefully they would welcome the subsequent disarming
            of their suspicions.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>Puakawa</i> wound up his oration by declaring that there were
            about half the goods now shown that had been on the deck the day before. His audience,
            however, who had carefully examined the heaps, expressed the same frank dissent which
            never failed to attend upon any of his statements which exceeded the bounds of truth, or
            seemed improbable as conjectures.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> The debate had lasted till sunset; and all but the elder chiefs
            returned to the shore for the night.</div>

            distribution of payment</button>

            <h3>Distribution Of Payment.</h3>
            <div class="jerningham"> September 27th. --This morning the distribution on the deck of
                the goods commenced; <i>Warepori</i> superintending it with much formality, and
                several of the chiefs addressing the numerous spectators at intervals. Some trouble
                arose from the desire not to open the cases of muskets, of which there were only
                five, that some might be sent to each of the six settlements. In these large
                acquisitions of property, the natives always like to receive a bale, a case, or a
                cask whole, as the transaction assumes a more opulent appearance in the opinion of
                the other tribes among whom the news travels. For instance, more pigs can be
                obtained for an unbroken cask of tobacco, than for the contents divided into many
                small portions, and exchanged against single pigs. My uncle, on becoming aware of
                the difficulty, at once gave them a sixth case, which made things quite smooth.
            </div>
            <div class="jerningham"> <i>Warepori</i> placed equal portions of all the other goods on
                each of the musket-cases, till they were expended. He reserved but little for
                himself; keeping some powder and cartridges, in order to be ready for war. Several
                of the other chiefs showed equal disinterestedness, and declared that their
                principal object was to get white people to live among them. A handsome young man,
                named <i>E Tako,</i> who was nearly related to Mrs. Barrett, received the share for
                his father, the chief of <i>Pipitea</i> and <i>Kumu toto,</i> two contiguous
                settlements at the south-west end of the harbour; and he arrayed himself in a good
                suit of clothes selected from the heap. He had taken an active and eager part in
                promoting the agreement, and bringing it to a conclusion. Old "Dog's-ear" received
                the share for his settlement, which is called <i>Kai Wara Wara; Epuni</i> received
                that for <i>Pitone; Warepori</i> himself took charge of the portion assigned to his
                immediate followers at <i>Nga hauranga,</i> and dispatched a share which had been
                made purposely smaller to the <i>pa Te Aro,</i> the most southerly of the
                settlements, where a tributary tribe, called the <i>Taranaki,</i> had their
                habitation. The sixth share was assigned to <i>Puakawa</i> and his followers, who
                had determined, when they saw the others receiving their shares satisfactorily, to
                desist from any further opposition. He accordingly took charge of the goods, and,
                though in silence, followed the example of the others.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> I had prepared a deed according to Colonel Wakefield's
                instructions, nearly in the words of some deeds which we had on board, that had been
                drawn on the model of those used by missionary land-buyers in the northern part of
                the island. The boundaries and native names being inserted from <i>Warepori's</i>
                dictation, the deed was brought on deck, and laid on the capstern. As I read it
                through, sentence by sentence, in English, Barrett interpreted into <i>Maori;</i>
                and he was repeatedly urged by Colonel Wakefield to explain fully each important
                provision contained in it. The Native Reserves were especially dwelt upon. Although
                the natives had repeatedly discussed every point, and this was therefore only a
                repetition of the agreement to which they had all given an ample assent on several
                occasions, and though they were anxious to get the goods on shore, and the
                distribution there ended, they listened with great attention and decorum to the
                recapitulation of the deed in both languages. The chiefs then came up in succession
                to the capstern, in order to make their marks. As each one's name was called, I
                wrote it down, and held the pen whilst he made a mark opposite. They all brought
                their sons with them, in order, as they suggested, to bind them in the transaction,
                and to prove that they looked forward to the future.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> The boats were then sent away with the goods to the
                settlements; the chief of each accompanying them, and undertaking to distribute them
                at his own place. The officers in charge of the boats reported on their return, that
                not the slightest tumult had attended the landing, and that the greatest quietness
                and order had prevailed while the chief apportioned the lots of each head of a
                family.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> <i>Warepori</i> and <i>Epuni</i> appeared at our dinner-table
                to-day, dressed in their newly-acquired suits of clothes, and looked very
                respectable. The former, however, soon came into my uncle's cabin to undress, as he
                found the coat and shoes made him very uneasy. Both these chiefs had been to Sydney,
                and were exceedingly desirous of becoming like an English gentleman.</div>
        </div>
        <h3>Nicknames</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> During the time taken up in discussions, I had acquired a great
            many words of <i>Maori,</i> and began to understand a good deal and make myself
            understood a little. I had become very good friends with the natives in various
            excursions ashore, and was designated by a nickname while here, which remained from this
            time my only name among them till I left the country. Some of the young people had made
            many attempts to pronounce "Edward Wakefield," on receiving an answer to their question
            as to my name. The nearest approach they could make to it was <i>Era weke,</i> and some
            wag immediately suggested "<i>Tiraweke,"</i> the name of a small bird which is very
            common in the woods, and known for its chattering propensities. <button class="inline"
                data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#info2" aria-expanded="false"
                aria-controls="info2">i</button>
            <div id="info2" class="info collapse width">
                <p>"Tiraweke" is another name for the tieke, or saddleback. <a
                        href="http://nzbirdsonline.org.nz/species/north-island-saddleback">Listen to
                        its call</a> and decide for yourself whether this is a flattering reference.
                </p>
            </div> As I had made it a point to chatter as much as possible with them, whether
            according to <i>Maori</i> grammar or not, they agreed that the <i>sobriquet</i> would
            do, and reported their invention at the <i>pa.</i> The old men and chiefs were not a bit
            behind their juniors in their hilarity and fondness for a joke, and never called me
            otherwise afterwards. They also christened Colonel Wakefield <i>"Wide-awake,"</i> after
            some chief who had been so called by the flax-traders in former times; and this name
            also has clung to him ever since.
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Dr. Dieffenbach and Mr. Heaphy engaged some native guides one day
            to go and look for some birds called <i>huia,</i> which were said to abound in this part
            of the country.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> The <i>huia</i> is a black bird about as large as a thrush, with
            long thin legs, and a slender semicircular beak, which he uses for seeking in holes of
            trees for the insects on which he feeds. In the tail are four long black feathers tipt
            with white. These feathers are much valued by the natives as ornaments for the hair on
            great occasions; and are highly esteemed as presents from the inhabitants of this
            neighbourhood to those of the north, where the bird is never found. Near the insertion
            of the beak, a fleshy yellow wattle is placed on either side. </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Our sportsmen crossed the mouth of the <i>Heretaonga</i> river, and
            ascended a steep ridge of the eastern hills. Among the forests on the top they remained
            ensconced in the foliage, while the natives attracted the birds by imitating the
            peculiar whistle, from which it takes the name of <i>huia.</i> They only shot two or
            three, which had followed the decoy almost on to the barrels of their guns.</div>
        <div class="simon">
            <p>Charles Heaphy gave a more detailed (and heartbreaking) account of this hunting trip
                in an address to the Wellington Philosophical Society in 1879.</p>
            <div style="margin-left: 2em;">
                <p>"The forest was then teeming with birds. Of twelve or fourteen species of small
                    birds that were then to be seen in every wood, on1y the tui, the fly-catcher,
                    and the wren, with the sand-lark, in the open, are now common, while the robin,
                    the bell-bird, the titmouse, the thrush, the popokatea, the tiraweke, and the
                    riroriro, are rarely seen or have entirely passed away.</p>
                <p>Of the larger birds, the kokako, or crow, the rail, pukeko, pigeon, kaka, and
                    huia, were numerous in their respective localities or feeding-grounds. Of a
                    night might be heard the booming, or "drum", of the bittern (Botaums
                    pceciloptilns). The weka (Ocydronius earli), now common about the Hutt Valley,
                    was then so scarce, that for more than three months our naturalist was unable to
                    obtain one, alive or dead, or even to see a skin. I think this singular
                    alteration in the bird's numbers has been noticed in Southland. This bird,
                    although not at all shy, is very pugnacious, and can defend its young from
                    either the rat or the cat, hence, probably, its singular increase.</p>
                <p>The huia (Heteralocha acutirostris) was then to be found in the ranges between
                    Wainuiomata and Palliser Bay. Dr. Dieffenbach, the naturalist, was anxious to
                    obtain some, and I accompanied him, making sketches, to the high range that
                    overlooks Palliser Bay. The natives are very fond of the feathers of this
                    handsome, dark, velvetty bird, with its yellow wattles and white-tipped tail,
                    and two boys readily went with us as guides. There was no occasion to take much
                    food into the bush in those days - the gun supplied game enough - and though the
                    month was September, one blanket was considered sufficient bedding for the
                    open-air bivouac.</p>
                <p>We struck in from near Lowry Bay, and reached the source of the Orongo stream
                    before night. There was no path whatever. We shot some kakas and snared a
                    kokako, but saw no huias. We made a good fire as night approached. The natives
                    were awfully afraid of the Wairarapa people, against whom they had lately
                    fought, and while we slept with our feet near the fire, they sat crouched, with
                    our guns in their hands, listening to detect any possibly approaching footsteps,
                    for they were on the debateable land of the two tribes.</p>
                <p>The only sound worth noticing was the beautiful melody, towards morning, of the
                    bell-birds. Thousands of these were singing together, and, probably by some
                    auricular delusion, the sound seemed to arrange itself into scales, like peals
                    of bells running down octaves. As the sun rose this music ceased altogether.
                    From the top of the range we had a fine view of Palliser Bay and the Wairarapa
                    Lakes. On our way homeward the natives suddenly stopped ; they heard in the
                    distance the peculiar cry of the huia. Imitating this, and adding a peculiar
                    croak of their own, which they said was very attractive, our guides soon brought
                    two birds - a male and female - within shooting distance. We abstained from
                    firing for a moment, admiring the elegant movements of these birds as they
                    leaped from tree to tree, peering inquisitively at us, and gradually coming
                    nearer. We now fired with light charges, and brought each a bird down. Our
                    natives were annoyed at our "griffinism." They had intended, by a further
                    allurement of a peculiar gutteral croak, to have brought the birds so near as to
                    capture them with a common slip-knot at the end of a stick - a process which we
                    saw subsequently performed with entire success." </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> I had formed one of several shooting parties and fishing
            excursions. The former were generally conducted in the different creeks into which the
            river divides from a kind of tidal lagoon inside the sand-bar, and we fell in with
            numerous pigeons and wild-ducks while exploring their courses as high as our boat could
            proceed. The grandeur of the forest which overshaded these clear creeks, the luxuriance
            and entanglement of the underwood, and the apparent richness of the soil, could nowhere
            be exceeded. We longed to see the time when the benefit of the latter should be reaped
            by industrious English yeomen.</div>
        <h3>Fish--Native Hook.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> Our fishing parties were generally directed to a snug cove about a
            mile south-east of the river's mouth, which we christened Lowry Bay, after the first
            mate, who used to be head fisherman, and direct our bungling exertions in the management
            of the sean. In this place we generally had a fine haul of plaice, sole, and several
            other kinds of fish. On the beach near <i>Pitone</i> we obtained several immense hauls,
            whenever a shoal of <i>kawai</i> came into that part of the bay. The <i>kawai</i> has
            somewhat of the habits of the salmon, entering during the spring and summer into the
            bays, rivers, and fresh- water creeks in large shoals: it resembles the mackerel in
            appearance, but is not equal in flavour to either of those fish. The natives catch large
            quantities of them with a bone hook at the end of a fish-shaped piece of wood, inlaid
            with the shell of <i>the</i> mutton-fish, or <i>haliotus,</i> which bears the lively
            colours and brilliancy of mother-o'-pearl. This hook requires no bait, and a dozen of
            them are dragged along the water by a canoe which pulls at full speed through the shoal.
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> There are many other sorts of fish, including the <i>tamore,</i> or
            snapper; the <i>manga,</i> or barracoota; the <i>mango,</i> or dog-fish, of which the
            natives catch and store large quantities, by drying them in the sun; and the
            <i>hapuka.</i> This last fish is caught in pretty deep water, near reefs and rocks. It
            often reaches a great size, weighing as much as 112 lbs. It bears a considerable
            resemblance to the cod in form, but is, however, of far finer flavour. The head and
            shoulders, especially, when cooked, seem a mass of jelly. The <i>moki</i> is also a
            well-flavoured fish, weighing 10 lbs. or 12 lbs.</div>

            for a celebration</button>
        <div class="collapse" id="collapse3">
            <div class="jerningham"> Sunday, 29th. --After prayers, Colonel Wakefield went round the
                harbour with <i>Warepori</i> to visit the different settlements, in order to see how
                the people were satisfied, and to invite them to a sort of festival which was to be
                held on the occasion at <i>Pitone</i> on Monday. At the slave settlement, <i>Te Aro,
                    Warepori</i> addressed the occupants, who had the same abject dependent
                appearance which we had remarked in the <i>Rangitane</i> at the Pelorus River. He
                told them what benefits would accrue to them, and excused himself for having sent
                them a smaller share of the goods, as the free settlements had required a large
                proportion; but encouraged them by reminding them that they were now armed, and in a
                position to defend themselves, should they he attacked by <i>Rauperaha</i> and the
                "Boiling-water" tribes. He dwelt on the promotion in caste which they would by this
                means obtain, as "each man that fell would now be buried with his musket and
                cartouch-box, and be mourned over as a warrior that died with arms in his hands." He
                thus eloquently conciliated those who had been a little jealous of the unequal
                partition; and when one of the missionary teachers came forward to reproach him for
                not having kept half the land for the White missionaries expected from the north, he
                administered a severe rebuke to his assailant, which was loudly applauded by the
                listening multitude.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> "How can you," retorted he, "who are a child, reprove me for
                anything that I have done? If I had sold the land to the White missionaries, might
                they not have sold it again to <i>Wiwi</i> <a href="#note1" id="note_ref1">
                    <div class="superscript">1</div>
                </a>(Frenchmen) or Americans? This <i>rangatira-hoia</i> (soldier-chief)," he
                continued, "will bring many English from their country, and how could they live with
                a hostile tribe? They are not all Englishmen that come from Europe: there is a White
                man on board the ship who is not English: I know him by his tongue. This was in
                allusion to Dr. Dieffenbach. We were rather surprised to find so much knowledge of
                nations and preference for the English in <i>Warepori's</i> mind; but he had most
                likely acquired it among the flax-traders, and during his visit to Sydney.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> He concluded his speech, after getting into the boat, by saying
                that his wish had been to satisfy everybody, and that he had kept nothing for
                himself; that he should learn English, and go to England. He laid his head on
                Colonel Wakefield's knee, and said that if the natives were discontented with him,
                he should live with the White men, and that the tribe of England should be his
                fathers.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> At this place Colonel Wakefield proposed to pay for the chapels
                and houses which the missionary delegates had built on a piece of flat land where he
                intended to fix the site of the town; but <i>Warepori</i> objected, saying that he
                had already paid for the whole of the land and everything upon it.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> At each of the other settlements Colonel Wakefield engaged the
                natives to be active in collecting provisions, clearing land, and bringing timber
                for building to the site of the town. <i>Warepori</i> supported the request, and
                then asked the young men to collect at <i>Pitone,</i> in order to join in a
                war-dance to be given in the morning. Colonel Wakefield was universally treated as a
                benefactor, and we had the satisfaction of hearing on all hands expressions of
                contentment at the purchase-money, and eager hope for the speedy arrival of the
                settlers. The chiefs repeatedly impressed upon the people that their land was gone
                for ever, with the exception of what the White people would allow them for
                cultivation and residence; that they would never receive any further payment for it,
                but would be paid for any labour which they performed for the White people; and that
                the contract would be considered <i>tapu,</i> and as inviolable as any of the
                reservations of holy places which are often made among themselves.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> 30th. --This morning we observed the natives gathering from all
                parts of the harbour. Canoes and parties on foot, glittering with their lately
                acquired red blankets and muskets, were all closing in upon the place of rendezvous;
                fresh smokes rose every moment on shore as a new oven was prepared for the feast;
                and <i>Warepori</i> and the other chiefs who had slept on board went on shore early
                to make the necessary preparations, accompanied by our carpenter, who was to
                superintend the erection of a small tree which the natives had procured for the
                purpose, as a flag-staff, close to the <i>Pitone pa.</i> In the afternoon, on a
                signal from the shore, we landed in our boats with all the cabin party, and all the
                sailors that could be spared, to take part in the rejoicings. We were joyfully
                received by the assemblage, which consisted of about three hundred men, women, and
                children. Of these, two hundred were men, and had armed themselves with the hundred
                and twenty muskets they had received from us, spears, tomahawks, pointed sticks,
                stone and wooden clubs, &amp;c. Even a dozen umbrellas, which had formed part of the
                payment, figured in the ranks as conspicuously as the Emperor of Marocco's son's
                parasol has figured in more recent battalions. Every one was dressed in some of the
                new clothes; their heads were neatly arranged, and ornamented with feathers of the
                albatross or <i>huia;</i> handsome mats hung in unison with the gay petticoats of
                the women and the new blankets of the warriors; the latter were bedizened with
                waist-coats and shirts, and belted with cartouch-boxes and shot-belts. It was high
                holiday with everybody; and a universal spirit of hilarity prevailed among the
                excited multitude.</div>
        </div>
        <h3>War-Dance.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> As we landed Colonel Wakefield ordered the New Zealand flag to be
            hoisted at the staff; and the same was done at the main of the Tory, which saluted it
            with twenty-one guns, to the great delight of the natives at the noise and smoke.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>Warepori</i> then asked if we were ready; and told us that many
            men were absent, some at their distant gardens, some on an expedition to the westward,
            and some deterred by the bad weather which had prevailed during the morning. He then
            took his station at the head of one of the parties into which the fighting-men were
            divided, "Dog's-ear" having marshalled the other at a little distance. <i>Warepori</i>
            was dressed in a large hussar cloak belonging to my uncle, to which he had taken a
            fancy, and brandished a handsome green-stone <i>meri.</i> His party having seated
            themselves in ranks, he suddenly rose from the ground and leaped high into the air with
            a tremendous yell. He was instantly imitated by his party, who sprang out of their
            clothes as if by magic, and left them in bundles on the ground. They then joined in a
            measured guttural song recited by their chief, keeping exact time by leaping high at
            each louder intonation, brandishing their weapons with the right hand, and slapping the
            thigh with the left as they came heavily upon the ground. The war-song warmed as it
            proceeded; though still in perfect unison, they yelled louder and louder, leaped higher
            and higher, brandished their weapons more fiercely, and dropped with the smack on the
            thigh more heavily as they proceeded, till the final spring was accompanied by a
            concluding whoop which seemed to penetrate one's marrow. After this preparatory
            stimulant, the two parties ran down to the beach, and took up positions facing each
            other at about two hundred yards' distance. They then repeated the dance; and at its
            conclusion the two parties passed each other at full speed, firing their guns as they
            ran, and took up a fresh position nearer to each other.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> A small reinforcement was now brought up from <i>Puakawa's,</i>
            village at the mouth of the river to one of the parties; and we were much surprised to
            see at the head of it Richard Davis, the missionary teacher, dressed in warlike costume,
            and his head bedecked with <i>huia</i> feathers. He took an eager part in the
            proceedings, and was the bearer of a sort of sham challenge from one party to the other.
            They now for a third time went through the <i>pero pero,</i> or "war-dance;" <button
                class="inline" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#info4"
                aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="info4">i</button>
            <div id="info4" class="info collapse width">
                <p>This is "peruperu", the strongest form of haka, performed with weapons.</p>
            </div> but dispensed with any sham-fighting, as the day was nearly at an end, and they
            wished everything to terminate in an amicable way. Many of the women had joined in the
            wildest part of the dance, yelling and grimacing with as demoniacal a frenzy as any of
            the men. We were shown some natives from <i>Wanganui,</i> a settlement some distance
            north of <i>Kapiti,</i> who distinguished themselves by their ferocious appearance. They
            had blackened all round their eyes with charcoal, and painted themselves copiously with
            streaks of red ochre and oil; they performed their part with excessive vigour and
            <i>gusto,</i> and looked, when in the ecstasy of the dance, like demons incarnate.
            Barrett and <i>Warepori</i> told us that these <i>Wanganui</i> natives were looked upon
            as the most savage and warlike even by the other tribes, and that they spoke a different
            dialect from the <i>Ngatiawa.</i> They were closely allied, at this time, with the
            latter.
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> A <i>haka</i> was now performed by about one hundred and fifty men
            and women. They seated themselves in ranks in one of the court-yards of the <i>pa,</i>
            stripped to the waist. An old chieftainess, who moved along the ranks with regular
            steps, brandishing an ornamented spear in time to her movements, now recited the first
            verse of a song in a monotonous, dirge-like measure. This was joined in by the others,
            who also kept time by quivering their hands and arms, nodding their heads and bending
            their bodies in accordance with each emphasis and pause. These songs are often made
            impromptu on various subjects; but those selected for the present occasion were
            principally ancient legends.</div>
        <h3>Contentment Of Natives.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> At the conclusion of the <i>haka,</i> we were served from the ovens
            with the joints of a pig, which had been sacrificed for the occasion, and the whole
            assemblage partook of an ample meal. We drank the healths of the chiefs and people of
            Port Nicholson in bumpers of champagne, and, christening the flag-staff, took formal
            possession of the harbour and district for the New Zealand Land Company, amidst the
            hearty cheers of the mixed spectators. The whole scene passed with the greatest harmony,
            and we were sensibly struck by the remarkable good feeling evinced towards us by the
            natives.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> This disposition continued unabated during the three days more that
            we remained at this place. The natives, whether chieftains, inferiors, or slaves,
            treated us with the greatest kindness and affection. <i>Warepori</i> suggested that a
            deputation should proceed in the ship to assist us in buying the district of
            <i>Taranaki,</i> from which they were driven, and of which all who had been there,
            whether natives or White men, spoke in the highest terms. He also spoke of a flat and
            fertile district to the eastward, called <i>Wairarapa,</i> which opens into Palliser
            Bay. He declared it <i>tapu</i> for Colonel Wakefield, and swore by his head that no one
            else should have any of it till he had been to see it. Barrett told us that it answered
            his description, and had a fresh-water stream running through it into Palliser Bay.
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>Epuni's</i> eldest son, <i>E Ware,</i> and a young chief named
            <i>Tuarau,</i> nephew of a former head chief of the <i>Ngatiawa</i> tribes, were
            selected to go with us to <i>Taranaki,</i> and took up their berths on board. <i>E
                Ware</i> had accompanied Captain Chaffers in a surveying expedition in one of the
            boats during the last week, of which an excellent chart of the harbour was the result.
            As soon as this was drawn, Colonel Wakefield proceeded to name the various points and
            bays. The south-western bay, where the most secure anchorage exists, and where the town
            was to be built, was named Lambton Harbour, in honour of the Earl of Durham, who was
            Governor of the Company, and had been a warm patron of the project in England. A piece
            of level ground, over which the town was to extend, was named Thorndon Flat, from
            Thorndon Hall in Essex, the residence of Lord Petre, who had also forwarded with his
            unceasing support the intended colony. The river <i>Heretaonga</i> received the name of
            Mr. William Hutt, another of the most energetic friends of the undertaking. The large
            island <i>Matiu</i> was christened Somes's Island, after Mr. Joseph Somes, the then
            Deputy-Governor of the Company. The most remarkable headlands at the entrance were named
            after Mr. Francis Baring, Sir George Sinclair, and Pencarrow, the residence of Sir
            William Molesworth; and the names of other places were selected from among those likely
            to be respected and honoured by the future inhabitants as memorials of the disinterested
            founders of the colony. Barrett's Reef must not be omitted in this list, as
            commemorating our worthy and honest co-operator.</div>
        <h3>Sanguine Prospects.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> The utmost satisfaction prevailed among all on board, at the
            conclusion of all the arrangements, as well as among the natives. We felt that we had
            secured, by an honourable bona fide transaction with the natives, an unexceptionable
            harbour and site for a town; and although the neighbouring land, with the exception of
            the valley of the Hutt, was rather rugged, we considered this as no lasting obstacle to
            the fitness of the place for a colony. Indeed, compared with the land on the Middle
            Island, the hills here appeared both low and easy of cultivation. We were moreover
            convinced, by the numerous accounts which we had gathered from White adventurers as well
            as natives, that this was the only harbour accessible to large shipping between
            <i>Manukau</i> on the west side of the North Island and the Thames on the opposite
            coast; and that the shipping and trade of that extensive coast-line must be sure to
            centre here.</div>
        <button class="btn btn-primary" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse"
            data-bs-target="#collapse4" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse4">Self
            congratulations (and complaining)</button>
        <div class="collapse" id="collapse4">
            <div class="jerningham"> But a far more satisfactory circumstance was the peculiarly
                agreeable way in which we felt sure of dealing with the native population. Their
                contentment and thorough appreciation of our good intentions in their favour, their
                spontaneous approbation of the whole transaction, which gave it more force and
                solemnity in our eyes than the most binding legal forms, and their pleasing
                eagerness for the arrival of our companions, all combined to induce in us great
                hopes of success. We felt how fortunate we had been in finding a population so
                uncontaminated by the vices of irregular colonization, so free from any prejudice
                for or against any class of strangers. We were therefore sanguine in our hopes that
                the colonists would be happy among a people so well disposed to greet them, and that
                the warm feelings of benevolence which we knew to be entertained by the principal
                intending settlers would be exercised upon a genial soil, when they should encourage
                the natives to co-operation with them in measures conducive to their own benefit and
                improvement. We relied much on the fact that this people acknowledged the powerful
                influence of one or two chiefs; and we hoped, by maintaining these latter, as
                persons entitled to respect and authority among their own people as well as among
                the emigrants, to work, through them, a beneficial change and speedy amelioration of
                the moral and physical condition of the natives.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> If this inferior race were to be raised to our own level, it
                could only be done by means of a process analogous to their own customs. It seemed,
                therefore, reasonable to suppose that their institutions might be most effectually
                improved by means of the very men whom those institutions had set forth as the heads
                and guides of their fellow-countrymen. We looked upon <i>Warepori, Epuni,</i> and
                <i>Puakawa,</i> as capable of being admitted amongst the leading men of the colony;
                and as certain, when stirred by emulation and worthy ambition, to take pride in
                propagating by their influence a reform, easy and gradual because its successive
                steps should be appreciated, recommended, and adopted by those whose advice would
                obtain the greatest respect, and whose example would be followed with the most
                implicit confidence.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> We confessed to ourselves that the apparent hostility of the
                native missionaries seemed to augur some difficulties; but we persuaded ourselves
                that they had exceeded their mission. They were all men who had been taken in war as
                slaves by the Northern tribes, and who had returned, upon their emancipation by
                their converted masters, to spread the doctrines which they had imbibed from the
                European missionaries in that part of the island.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Being debarred by native custom from resuming their previous
                caste after having been once enslaved, they were evidently very jealous of the
                authority of the chiefs, which they longed to overthrow, as opposed to the
                recognition of themselves as the guides of the tribe in matters temporal as well as
                spiritual. To this jealousy we attributed an undue dislike of such as, like
                ourselves, recognized the chiefs in actual authority as the only fit movers of the
                people. And we felt convinced that their hostile aspect was in excess of the
                instructions which they might have received from their Christian and</div>
            <h3>Missionary Hostility To Our Plans.</h3>
            <div class="jerningham"> civilized teachers. We were sanguine, at least, in our hopes
                that those among the latter who should candidly examine our proposed measures, would
                end by cordially co-operating with us in employing the chiefs as most apt
                instruments, while made equals with ourselves, in the work of civilization and
                conversion.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> It must be remembered that the projectors of the colony had
                invited the coalition of the Parent Missionary Societies at home in this scheme. It
                was calculated to shield their flocks from the consequences of the irregular and
                vicious colonization which had already exercised a very deteriorating influence on
                the worthy efforts of the missionaries in the north of the islands, and which was
                daily increasing in extent and danger, unrestrained by any law or authority. It was
                in part with a view to the removing numerous scenes of contamination, such as that
                which I have described at <i>Te-awa-iti,</i> that the plan of a regular and orderly
                colonization was first put forth by the Association in 1837, and persevered in by
                the Company.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> We remembered, too, Mr. Dandeson Coates's undeviating course of
                hostility to both the Association and the Company up to the moment of our embarking
                for New Zealand. His evidence before the House of Lords' Committee in 1838, and his
                refusal of the request made by one of our party for a copy of the grammar and
                vocabulary of the <i>Maori</i> language published by the Church Missionary Society,
                remained as proofs of Mr. Coates's determination, declared in words and published in
                pamphlets, that "he would thwart us by all the "means in his power."</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> The secretary of the Wesleyan Missionary Society had joined Mr.
                Coates in this course; and the Committees of both Societies had recorded their
                opinions in condemnation of our proceedings.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> We trusted, however, that these bitter feelings would not be
                continued long in the colony; and that no controversy or partisanship would be
                allowed to over-rule the conviction of our benevolent intentions which we felt sure
                of impressing on the Christian missionaries in New Zealand. We felt sure that their
                interest in the cause of religion, and their appreciation of a body of respectable
                settlers as co-operators and supporters in their work, combined with a knowledge of
                the ways in which example affected change in the native mind, would soon outweigh
                the opinion prejudicial to the colonists which they might have imbibed from their
                correspondents at home.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> In the meanwhile, the slave teachers were not likely to
                exercise much influence over the disposition of the great body of natives towards
                us; and we hoped that the White missionaries, when they did arrive, would come as
                friends and brethren in the great work.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Colonel Wakefield left with <i>Warepori</i> Mr. Smith, whom I
                mentioned above, with a stock of garden-seeds and carpenter's tools, and a few goods
                with which to encourage the natives in the work of preparation for the arrival of
                the settlers. <i>Warepori</i> promised to put him in a new house at his own
                settlement, and to take care of him till our return. We also landed some pigs of a
                superior breed before we sailed. Some boards bearing the words "New Zealand Land
                Company" were put up in conspicuous places on the shores of the harbour.</div>
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <div class="simon">
            <p>Now that we've heard Jerningham's account of it, here's what the Waitangi Tribunal
                had to say on the sale of Te Whanganui-a-Tara, in 2003.</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 2em;">"The company’s purported purchase of the
                Port Nicholson area was flawed in a number of respects. The explanation of the
                transaction to Maori and the delineation of the boundaries of the purchase were
                completely inadequate. No proper explanation was given to Maori of the ‘tenths’
                reserve scheme, nor were they made aware that the deed of purchase made no provision
                for the retention by Maori of their pa, cultivations, and burial grounds. The
                signatories were therefore in no position to understand what they were supposedly
                selling. In fact, the very concept of ‘a sale’ was foreign to Te Whanganui a Tara
                Maori, and they could have had no conception of the scale of settlement envisaged by
                the company. A further problem with the transaction was that the signatories did not
                represent all Maori having customary rights in the area covered by the deed. For
                these reasons, we have found that the deed was invalid and conferred no rights on
                the New Zealand Company or its settlers." (Waitangi Tribunal Report 2003, p. xvii)
            </p>
            <p>As they describe, there were three main issues with the sale, which Jerningham either
                ignores completely or glosses over.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dicky Barrett, who was responsible for translating the deeds of purchase and
                    explaining the terms to the local leaders probably didn't speak Te Reo Māori at
                    all, but rather "Whaler Māori", a mix of Māori, English, and French. As a
                    consequence, it's likely that the Māori signatories had little idea of the real
                    terms they were signing up to.</li>
                <li>The concept of land ownership among Māori was extremely complex, including
                    multiple overlapping rights to use, as well as acknowledging rights based on
                    occupancy, conquest, or long association. The concept of purchasing <i>total</i>
                    rights to an area of land was likely to be misunderstood.</li>
                <li>Many of the groups with interests or rights over Te Whanganui-a-Tara were not
                    involved in the purchase. Most notably, Ngāti Toa, who claimed right of conquest
                    over the area were left out of the purchase, as were those Tangata Whenua who
                    had recently been forced out of the area, but who had never conceded their claim
                    to the land.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's difficult to interpret these failings as simple misunderstandings or oversights.
                Jerningham seems aware of some of the complexities of Māori land ownership, and of
                the difficult political situation among the iwi at the time, and its hard to imagine
                he was the only member of the party who did. Given the New Zealand Company's urgency
                to make purchases before the British parliament could intervene, it seems very
                likely that they chose to make a purchase on whatever basis they could, with the
                intention of patching up any problems after the fact. This aligns with their overall
                strategy of establishing their Colony as a "fate accompli" before the law could
                catch up with them.</p>
            <p>As we'll see, these issues will come back to haunt the settlement much sooner than I
                believe they expected.</p>
