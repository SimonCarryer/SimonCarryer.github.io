                                                visited some parts of the coast of New Zealand in a trading schooner
                                                from Van Diemen's Land, and who was engaged as storekeeper and
                                                additional interpreter; the second and third mates; and Colonel

                                            <p class="div1"> Petty officers and foremast hands, among whom were a New
                                                Zealander and a native of the Marquesas Islands, made up our total

                                            <p class="div1"> The Tory sailed remarkably well. We crossed the line, in 26
                                                deg. 50' W. longitude, on the twenty-sixth day from Plymouth, passed the
                                                longitude of the Cape of Good Hope on the 10th of July, and saw the high
                                                land of New Zealand on the 16th of August, about noon. We established
                                                during the voyage a weekly manuscript newspaper, and a debating society.
                                                These recreations, and an ample supply of useful and interesting books,
                                                caused the time to pass cheerfully enough. Vocabularies of the
                                                <i>Maori</i> or New Zealand language were also constructed from Nayti's
                                                dictation; and lessons to him in English spelling, many a deep game of
                                                chess, and an occasional <i>battue</i> of the albatrosses and other
                                                marine birds, which abound in the high latitudes between the Cape of
                                                Good Hope and Van Diemen's Land, beguiled the leisure time. These
                                                <i>battues</i> partook of shooting and fishing; for sometimes we baited
                                                large hooks with bits of pork, and caught the gigantic birds by the
                                                beak. I remember one day seeing twenty-eight live albatrosses on the

                                            <p class="div1"> Having fairly entered the middle of Cook's Strait by
                                                sunset, we hove to with a fresh N. W. breeze till daylight. Once or
                                                twice during the night we found soundings in about fifty fathoms. This
                                                was conjectured to be near the mouth of Blind Bay.</p>

                                                When I came on deck we had land in sight on both bows. Bearing away for
                                                the southern land, we soon made out Stephens Island, and passed within
                                                five or six miles of it. As we ran along the coast, D'Urville's Island,
                                                the Admiralty Islands, Point Lambert, and Point Jackson were
                                                successively recognized from Cook's chart. The high rugged land of the

                                                mainland on the north coast of Cook's Strait, were now very distinctly
                                                visible; a bright warm sun gave the most charming appearance to the
                                                romantic shores of the Sound; and we exclaimed against the calm which
                                                seemed likely to detain us another night at sea. Two or three of the
                                                most impatient got into the cutter, and pulled towards Point Jackson, to
                                                try and catch some fish; but they had not got far before a light air
                                                sprang up, and we glided into the Sound. The tide favouring us, they had
                                                some trouble in overtaking the ship. The scenery became more and more
                                                majestic as we advanced into this noble estuary. Its outer mouth is nine
                                                miles wide. High wooded mountains rise on both sides; numerous islands
                                                and projecting points dot the expanse of still water which penetrates
                                                far into the interior; and a glimpse of the Southern Alps is obtained in
                                                the extreme distance. We proceeded between Long Island and
                                                <i>Motuara.</i> The former, a narrow ridge bare of wood, was crowned
                                                with native fortifications; a small <i>pa</i> or fort was also visible
                                                on the south point of <i>Motuara.</i> As we entered the Sound, we saw
                                                four canoes under sail, coming from the westward. Before we anchored for
                                                the night in the S. E. entrance of Ship Cove, another canoe came
                                                paddling off to us, containing eight natives. We at first thought they

                                                stopped her way, the canoe was lashed to the chains, and the men
                                                scrambled on deck with great activity. We were at first startled by the
                                                quickness with which this was done, and by their wild, half-naked
                                                appearance. All our anticipations had not prepared us thoroughly for
                                                this first meeting; and our friend Nayti was so quiet and silent in his
                                                manners, that the contrast of their demeanour was striking. They ran
                                                about shaking hands with everybody they met, and seemed to consider
                                                their appearance as a matter of course. One of them, a tall muscular
                                                young man, ran to assist the helmsman, and seemed proud to display some
                                                knowledge of nautical terms and the manoeuvres of a ship. They all spoke
                                                more or less broken English, and chattered in a sort of authoritative
                                                way about the best anchorage, giving themselves quite the airs belonging
                                                to a pilot. They had brought on board some fish and potatoes, which we
                                                bought for a little tobacco. Night closed in as we let go our anchor,
                                                and they returned to their village.</p>

                                                farther into the cove, and anchored in 11 fathoms, muddy bottom, within
                                                300 yards of the shore, where we fastened a hawser to a tree; thus
                                                occupying probably the same spot as Captain Cook, in his numerous visits
                                                to this harbour. There were a good many natives on board already; but,
                                                eager to touch the land, I got into a small canoe with Nayti, who
                                                paddled me ashore. The hills, which rise to the height of 1000 or 1500
                                                feet on three sides of the cove, are covered from their tops to the
                                                water's edge with an undulating carpet of forest. How well Cook has
                                                described the harmony of the birds at this very spot! Every bough seemed
                                                to throng with feathered musicians, and the melodious chimes of the

                                                land, formed by the alluvial deposit of three rills from the mountains,
                                                which here empty themselves into the bay. Landing here, I remained for
                                                some time absorbed in contemplating the luxurious vegeta- tion of grass
                                                and shrubs, and the wild carrots and turnips which remain as relics of
                                                our great navigator. Rich historical recollections crowded on my mind as
                                                I tried to fix on the exact spot where Cook's forge and carpenter's shop
                                                had stood; and I was only roused from my reverie by the arrival of some
                                                more of the party, bent on the same object. We collected some shells,
                                                pebbles, and plants, and returned to breakfast on fresh potatoes and
                                                some of the fish which had been caught in abundance from the ship in the
                                                evening.</p>
                                            <p class="div1"> The four canoes which we had seen yesterday arrived this
                                                morning, and came alongside the ship. They came from Admiralty Bay, and
                                                were bound to Cloudy Bay, with pigs and potatoes for sale. Having seen
                                                us stand in, they came in hopes of having a deal with us; and they also
                                                told us that they were going through the Sound, thus confirming Nayti's
                                                previous account that its eastern side consisted of an island. They had
                                                not abandoned any of their savage customs, and rubbed noses with Nayti
                                                instead of shaking him by the hand. They were also covered with oil and
                                                red ochre, and seemed much wilder in their manners than our friends of
                                                Ship Cove. These latter informed us that they had been lately visited by
                                                a missionary schooner, and that they shook hands because they were all
                                                "missionaries." We could not, however, discover whether Wesleyan or
                                                Church missionaries had converted them; and we soon found that they were
                                                not yet very attentive even to the forms of the new doctrine. They all
                                                wished to barter, although this was Sunday;</p>

                                                the offer of one of their daughters to remain on board with him. This
                                                was no doubt owing to the vicinity of the whale-ships and
                                                whaling-stations in and near Cloudy Bay. They were all, however, told to

                                                luxurious vegetation. The wood on the sides of the hills appeared almost
                                                impenetrable from the thick web of supple-jacks and creepers. We found
                                                no natives, the cove being under <i>tapu,</i> on account of its being
                                                the burial-place of a daughter of <i>Te Pehi,</i> the late chief of the
                                                <i>Kapiti,</i> or Entry Island, natives. Those who visited us came from
                                                a cove a little farther north, called Cannibal Cove by Cook, and
                                                <i>Anaho</i> by the natives. They are called the <i>Ngatihinatui</i>
                                                tribe, and their principal chief was named <i>Ngarewa,</i> or "The

                                                refitting the ship commenced to-day. The storekeeper was very busy
                                                laying in a stock of potatoes and pigs from the natives. A pipe bought a
                                                basket of potatoes weighing 20 lbs., and a red blanket bought three
                                                good-sized pigs. These terms, too, were considered liberal on our part.
                                                In the afternoon we went over in the boat to <i>Motuara,</i> the island
                                                on which Cook had his observatory and garden. It commands a fine view of

                                                covered with wild shrubs and flowers like an ornamental plantation. We

                                                with us to-day. Their behaviour was very re- spectable: they ate

                                                apologised to us for it. He seemed, too, suspicious and afraid of them,
                                                and inclined to cling to us in consequence.</p>

                                                or in the cabin amusing himself with a pipe and a book of prints, or
                                                trying to understand and answer our inquiries about his place and
                                                people. He did not appear to have much influence on the latter, and at
                                                any rate never exerted it. <i>Ehoro</i> guided us on shooting excursions
                                                up the sides of the hills, or joined our fishing parties to the next
                                                cove to the south, where we always had a good haul with our sean. The
                                                women of the village had almost all removed to Ship Cove, where they
                                                eagerly undertook the task of washing our clothes.</p>

                                                in order to have the advantage of proximity in their dealings with us.

                                                a spring put on the cable so that the ship's broadside might be brought
                                                to bear on the beach where the natives were encamped. During these
                                                preparations, one or two large war-canoes came round the northern point
                                                of the cove, and dashed in to the beach at great speed, the rowers
                                                singing in time with their paddles. A single canoe, full of natives, now
                                                came off to the ship. As they silently paddled round the stern, we
                                                observed that some carried their tomahawks and green-stone clubs or
                                                <i>meri ponamu.</i> The others kept their blankets and mats wrapped over
                                                everything but their heads. Our original persecutor was the first who
                                                attempted to ascend the ladder, tomahawk in hand; but he was startled to
                                                find at the top a sentry with musket and bayonet, and my uncle, who
                                                quietly but firmly told him to go ashore, and that he would allow no
                                                natives to come on board armed. "Dogskin," as we had nick- named him
                                                from his wearing a mat of that material, seemed inclined to persist in

                                                sticking out of my uncle's coat-pocket suddenly made him change his
                                                mind; and he descended into the canoe, which pulled slowly back to the
                                                shore. A smaller canoe next came off, with only a boy paddling, and an

                                                requested to be allowed to come on board. This was complied with; and
                                                the old gentleman introduced himself as <i>Te Wetu,</i> or "the Star."

                                                <i>Rauperaha,</i> the great chief at that place. He explained to us that
                                                every one would cry very much, and that then there would be much <i>kai

                                                whom had come with him in the morning to visit the <i>Ngatihinatui.</i>
                                                The war-canoes belonged to his party. He seemed much inclined to stop on
                                                board, and talked to us of the quarrel with great indifference. He
                                                asserted, though, that we ought to pay for the <i>tapu,</i> but
                                                suggested as an amendment, that the <i>utu,</i> or "payment," should be
                                                handed to him instead of "Dogskin." We therefore concluded that the

                                                was still wiry and strong. He was very amusing and fond of conversation.
                                                He told us all about his place, <i>Rangitoto,</i> which means
                                                "blood-coloured sky," and expressed his hope that we should pay it a

                                                the fifth having lately died. Having inquired how many the Kings of
                                                England had, he laughed heartily at finding that they were not so well
                                                provided, and repeatedly counted "four <i>wahine</i>" (women) on his
                                                fingers. We gave the natives a small present of tobacco, recovered the
                                                sean, and soon restored friendship, as they had become tired of being
                                                excluded from their market on board. <i>Te Wetu</i> took kindly to the

                                                family, who had taken no part whatever in the disturbances. The natives
                                                were rather puzzled at our display of force, and my uncle's firmness on

                                                native guide, to a village at the southern entrance of Queen Charlotte's
                                                Sound, which Nayti and also the resident natives described as containing
                                                a hundred White men, with three <i>rangatira,</i> or "chiefs." In the
                                                afternoon of the following day, he returned in a whale-boat with two
                                                Englishmen. One was named Williams, and was carpenter at the village in
                                                question, where he said there were about sixty Europeans or Americans
                                                living by whaling. The other was named Arthur, and owned the
                                                meeting-house in <i>Anaho</i> village. Both brought their native wives
                                                with them. That of Arthur belongs to the village, and he generally lives
                                                there in the summer. It was now, however, the season for whaling, in
                                                which pursuit we learnt that he was engaged; and he was in consequence
                                                living at <i>Te-awa-iti,</i> whence the boat came.</p>
                                            <p class="div1"> The crew of the whale-boat consisted of young native men,
                                                dressed in the costume of European seamen; and we heard that a great
                                                many of them are employed in the boats by the whalers.</p>
                                            <p class="div1"> The arrival of our countrymen produced a great change in
                                                the deportment of the natives. They now cringed to our new guests, who
                                                took but little notice</p>

                                                new-comers confirmed our idea that the demand of utu<i></i> was a mere
                                                extortion, and were much amused at the relation of our alarm and warlike
                                                demonstration. They told us that the natives were always ready to take
                                                advantage of inexperienced visitors in this way.</p>
                                            <p class="div1"> We could do nothing here towards attaining our object,
                                                which was to select and purchase a location suitable for the emigrants
                                                whom we expected to follow us in January. Neither <i>Ngarewa</i> nor
                                                <i>Te Wetu</i> could give us any distinct information as to the
                                                ownership of the land in this neighbourhood. They both spoke of
                                                <i>Rauperaha</i> as the great chieftain to whom they were in a measure
                                                tributary; but they seemed to agree that <i>Hiko,</i> the son of <i>Te
                                                    Pehi,</i> had the best right to the land here. Neither, however, was
                                                described as having an absolute right to dispose of land; and the vested
                                                rights appeared to us to be involved in much confusion. Our White
                                                friends could not clear up our doubts; and, moreover, it was plain that
                                                although the immediate vicinity of Ship Cove could boast of excellent
                                                harbours and sublime scenery, it was not at all suited for a large
                                                European colony. My uncle therefore determined to avail himself of the
                                                services of Williams and Arthur in piloting the vessel to
                                                <i>Te-awa-iti,</i> where we might acquire more information.</p>
                                            <p class="div1"> While we remained at anchor in Ship Cove, Dr. Dieffenbach
                                                had ascended two of the hills which bound the bay. On the first
                                                expedition he was accompanied by the artist and <i>Ehoro.</i> They
                                                emerged from the forest into a coppice of fern, ten feet high, which
                                                clothed the upper part of the hill. After a tedious scramble through
                                                this, they reached the summit, and were rewarded by a panoramic view of
                                                the numerous bays and coves of Queen Charlotte's Sound,</p>

                                            <p class="div1"> dotted with many islands, and the northern shore of Cook's
                                                Strait. They calculated the hill to be 800 feet above the level of the
                                                sea. The second hill he ascended with a native guide only. He obtained
                                                no view from the summit, as it was covered with the loftiest
                                                forest-trees. He ascertained the height by boiling water to be upwards
                                                of 1500 feet. His guide was a good deal frightened, and tried to
                                                dissuade him from proceeding, before they had completed the ascent, by
                                                legends of fierce monsters whom they would be sure to meet. On one
                                                occasion I formed one of a party who ascended the hill to a considerable
                                                height, by the course of one of the streams. We climbed up the sides of
                                                some picturesque waterfalls, and attained the top of a ridge covered
                                                with the largest trees. The trunks of some of these reached to the
                                                height of seventy or eighty feet without a branch. This elevated part of
                                                the forest was almost free from underwood, and moreover quite silent,
                                                the birds appearing to remain in the lower and more lively regions. It
                                                was impossible not to be struck by the majesty of this primaeval forest.

                                                Having completed most of our refittings, and laid in a good stock of
                                                potatoes and water, we weighed anchor at 10 in the morning, and stood up

                                                earned for him the sobriquet of "Jim Crow," which he retained during the
                                                whole time that he stuck to the ship. He had acquired his nautical
                                                knowledge on board a whaling-ship in which he had served. I have often
                                                seen him, in the violent gales which we weathered on various parts of
                                                the coast, out on the end of the yard-arm doing the work of the best man
                                                in reefing, and cheering the sailors to exertion by some broad joke or
                                                irresistible grimace. He was fully competent to do the work of an able
                                                seaman; and his good humour under all circumstances was invincible.</p>
                                            <p class="div1"> In gliding up the middle of the Sound, we discovered a
                                                succession of bays on either hand, each in itself a harbour. One or two
                                                are as large as Plymouth Sound, easy of access, and perfectly safe in
                                                all winds. With the exception of a <i>few</i> level spots, like that at
                                                the head of Ship Cove, the wooded mountains rise from the water's edge,
                                                many of them to a considerably greater height than even Mount
                                                Dieffenbach, as we christened the hill which the naturalist ascended
                                                without falling a victim to the fabulous genii of the place. Nothing can
                                                be imagined more magnificent than the scenery, or, however, less
                                                suitable for cultivation. It forcibly reminded me of the wildest parts
                                                of the Highlands of the Hudson, with a greater expanse of water. At 3 p.
                                                m. we reached the entrance of the channel which joins the Sound with
                                                Cook's Strait to the eastward. The entrance is about a mile wide; and
                                                the channel, which was christened Tory Channel after Captain Chaffers

                                                narrow strip of land, and running nearly parallel to the Sound for the
                                                greater part of its course. As we left the main arm of Queen Charlotte's
                                                Sound, we saw at its southern end, some six or seven miles from us, a
                                                tract of level land apparently two or three miles wide, from which a
                                                grove of high trees rose up.</p>
                                            <p class="div1"> The effect of the scenery was heightened by the remarkable
                                                clearness of the atmosphere. The distant land shone forth with distinct
                                                outline and brilliant colours. When we were at Ship Cove, the wooded
                                                edge of Entry Island, which is at least thirty miles distant, was
                                                generally plain to the eye, relieved against the snowy mountains of the
                                                North Island. As we entered into the narrow channel, the wind died away;
                                                but a tide, running four or five knots an hour, drifted us along. Eddies
                                                were formed on the shores, and we were obliged to have boats towing
                                                a-head in order to keep the ship in mid-channel. In most parts of the
                                                sound and channel the depth of water is from thirty to forty fathoms,
                                                even close in to the shore; but the numerous bays afford more secure
                                                anchorage, out of the influence of the tide. About half-way through the
                                                channel a small island lies in the mouth of one of these bays, crowned
                                                by the palisadoes of a native fort. The inhabitants eyed us eagerly from
                                                the shore, and one or two canoes approached the ship. They seemed
                                                cautious of too near intercourse. This was soon explained to us by our
                                                pilots. In the year 1838, the Pelorus, English brig-of-war, visited
                                                different parts of Cook's Strait, and did great service here by
                                                rendering justice to the injured party in many cases where complaint was
                                                made to the commander. After a display of gunnery close to this very
                                                <i>pa,</i> the commander demanded and obtained restitution of many

                                                <i>Huriwenua,</i> and his people, had distinguished themselves by their
                                                dishonesty and harassing conduct towards the Whites, and some of the
                                                guns were in consequence pointed against a stack of wood for fencing,
                                                which they knocked to pieces. This harmless show of strength produced an
                                                excellent effect; and the visit was so recent that their respect for our
                                                flag still existed. This fortified island is named <i>Mohio</i> by the

                                                or "The Little River." The whalers, who have a rough way of pronouncing
                                                the native language, have hardened this name into <i>Tarwhite.</i></p>
                                            <p class="div1"> As soon as we arrived, Mr. Richard Barrett, who was at the
                                                head of one of the whaling parties, came off in his boat to us. We had
                                                been highly amused at the comfortable obesity of Williams, and
                                                considered him a promising sample of the good effects of New Zealand
                                                feeding. What was our surprise on finding Dicky Barrett, as he is
                                                generally called, as much stouter in person as he was shorter! Dressed
                                                in a white jacket, blue dungaree trousers, and round straw hat, he
                                                seemed perfectly round all over; while his jovial, ruddy face, twinkling
                                                eyes, and good-humoured smile, could not fail to excite pleasure in all
                                                beholders. And a merry party it was to look upon, as we sat round a

                                                adventures and "hairbreadth 'scapes" of Barrett and his two

                                            <p class="div1"> at this spot. On the retreat of the invaders, the
                                                <i>Ngatiawa,</i> or aboriginal tribe, determined on seeking1 a new
                                                country, free from the incursions of the enemies whom they had only
                                                repulsed with great loss to their own ranks. Barrett had married the
                                                daughter of one of their principal chiefs, by whom he has several
                                                children. He and his comrades accompanied the <i>Ngatiawa</i> in their
                                                migration to the shores of Cook's Strait, which <i>Rauperaha</i> and
                                                <i>Te Pehi</i> had conquered and depopulated when those chiefs migrated
                                                from <i>Kawia</i> about the year 1825. This was about the year 1834.
                                                Some of the <i>Ngatiawa</i> had settled on the shores of Queen
                                                Charlotte's Sound, some in Blind Bay, others at Port Nicholson, and
                                                along the coast of the North Island, between that and <i>Kapiti.</i>
                                                Constant quarrels had occurred between the original conquerors, who
                                                chiefly belong to the <i>Ngatitoa</i> tribe, and their more numerous
                                                successors. <i>Rauperaha's</i> party took up their residence chiefly at
                                                <i>Kapiti,</i> Admiralty Bay, <i>Mana,</i> or Table Island, and Cloudy
                                                Bay. They are often called the <i>Kawia;</i> and they had been assisted,
                                                we learnt, in their attacks on the <i>Ngatiawa</i> by a tribe of natives
                                                called the <i>Waikorapupu,</i> or "boiling-water," who live on the
                                                mainland north of <i>Kapiti.</i> The acquaintance and assistance of
                                                Dicky Barrett promised to be most advantageous to us, as he was related
                                                by his wife to all the influential chiefs living at Port Nicholson. This
                                                was one of the spots to which the instructions of the Company
                                                particularly directed the attention of their agent, as being likely,
                                                from the description given by Nayti and other persons who had visited
                                                it, to prove a suitable spot for the establishment of the future colony.
                                                Barrett's account fully confirmed this idea; and he, after having been
                                                made acquainted with our views and projects, expressed himself willing

                                                <i>Muopoko, Rangitane,</i> and <i>Ngatiapa,</i> who were the original
                                                occupiers. And even the spots now occupied were in dispute between the
                                                conquerors and the <i>Ngatiawa,</i> who followed nine years afterwards
                                                in their track. The very superior number of the <i>Ngatiawa</i> seemed
                                                to constitute their only right to supplant the conquerors. We learned
                                                that a war in consequence of some such dispute had been only recently
                                                concluded in the north end of Queen Charlotte's Sound, and that the
                                                forts on Long Island were the remains of this war. It seems that
                                                <i>Rauperaha</i> had crossed the strait a year or two previously in
                                                canoes, and had established, <i>vi et armis,</i> his claim to that
                                                island and <i>Motuara,</i> which the <i>Ngatiawa</i> had disputed at the
                                                cost of eight men. The <i>Ngahitau,</i> too, who had originally occupied
                                                Cloudy Bay, had frequently followed their chief <i>Tuawaiki,</i> or
                                                "Bloody Jack," in expeditions to recover their settlements; and it was
                                                not many years since</p>

                                            <p class="div1"> <i>Rauperaha</i> had succeeded in driving them away, and
                                                establishing some of his relations in Port Underwood or <i>Wanganui,</i>
                                                the ship-harbour of Cloudy Bay. Thus it seemed, plain that, even with
                                                regard to the ownership of their villages and potato-gardens,
                                                <i>might</i> constituted the only right. As to the parts lying waste, we
                                                collected that they were not thought of or claimed by any one. Many
                                                White men had cleared and cultivated patches of land without bargain or
                                                interruption. These natives had not, like those in the neighbourhood of
                                                the Bay of Islands, learned that White men were willing to pay a high
                                                price for desert land; and there did not seem to have ever been any
                                                written bargain for land before our arrival. We had become aware, from
                                                the evidence of missionaries given before a Committee of the House of
                                                Lords in 1838, that a very different state of things prevailed in the
                                                northern part of the islands; but it was to be remembered that there, so
                                                early as 1814, Mr. Marsden, the founder of the Church Mission, had
                                                brought a formal deed from Sydney, in order to complete an agreement for
                                                the land on which the Mission buildings were to stand; and that, since
                                                that time, numerous similar purchases on a large scale had been made by
                                                the missionaries as well as by lay settlers, who created a considerable
                                                demand for land in that portion of the country. Dicky told us plainly,
                                                that our wish to purchase a large district of waste land would be looked
                                                upon as a novelty by the natives here. From the information which we
                                                gathered from him and other persons, I feel convinced that a large body
                                                of settlers might have pitched their tents in many parts of the
                                                neighbourhood entirely without interruption, and without being regarded
                                                by the natives as intruders on their rights.</p>

                                                them. He confessed that they would be sure to accept a payment, and that
                                                certainly they had a right to it, as we should probably include,
                                                villages and cultivations in such large districts as we proposed to buy.

                                            <p class="div1"> A very important part of our projected plan was, to reserve
                                                a tenth portion of the land bought by us for the benefit and use of the
                                                natives. We had it in view thus to secure a valuable property to them,
                                                which might preserve their chiefs in circumstances equal to those of the

                                                improvement and cultivation of the other lands with which they should be
                                                intermingled, and by the presence of a large and thriving civilized
                                                community, might afford the means of furnishing the natives with
                                                abundant revenue to support the dignity of their chiefs, with improved
                                                clothes and food, with houses like those of Europeans, with cattle and
                                                agricultural implements, with education and the means of religious
                                                worship; in short, with all that might make them respectable in the eyes
                                                of the future colony. It had of course been provided that these
                                                reserves, although <i>tapu</i> for the natives, should be inalienable by
                                                them, as it was foreseen that, without such a precaution, the natives
                                                would part with their reserves for a nominal value, as soon as they
                                                should acquire a real one in the eyes of speculating colonists. It had
                                                also been provided that the defects of the system of Indian reserves in
                                                North America should be avoided. There the reserves have been selected
                                                in huge blocks which lie unimproved themselves, and which, while they

                                                to produce there the same evils which arose from the excessive grants
                                                made to individuals at the first foundation of the colony of Swan River.
                                                The Indian reserves in Canada would doubtless become of real value to
                                                the Indians, if small portions of them could be given away to <i>bona

                                                land. The intervening parts of the great desert would then acquire more
                                                value, and produce more revenue, than the whole of it while it remained
                                                <i>tapu</i> to any but the Indians.</p>
                                            <p class="div1"> On a similar principle we proposed to confer a greater

                                                proposed to give them an immediate, ample, and satisfactory payment. In
                                                order to understand our provisions for this purpose, it is necessary to
                                                know the plan which the Company had projected before our departure, for
                                                the distribution of the land among the intending colonists.</p>

                                                adopted in all our colonies, the land was to be sold in England, at the
                                                rate of 100<i>l</i>. for each section, consist- ing of one acre in the
                                                site of the town, and a hundred acres in the surrounding country; and
                                                three-fourths of the proceeds were to be expended in carrying out
                                                labourers to the colony.</p>
                                            <p class="div1"> The first colony was to consist of a town of 1100 acres,

                                            <p class="div1"> sections, and the hundred sections reserved for the
                                                natives. To exemplify this, let us take an instance of what actually
                                                took place when this plan was carried into effect. Thus, upon the name
                                                of Mr. Duncan Dunbar being drawn, a ticket was drawn from another wheel,
                                                and turned up No. 1, giving him the right of the first choice of one
                                                among the 1100 town sections, and one among the 1100 country sections,
                                                as soon as they should be surveyed and marked on a map. The first native
                                                reserve drawn came up No. 7, thus securing the seventh best choice of
                                                one town and one country section, out of the same 2200 sections, to the
                                                native estate.</p>
                                            <p class="div1"> In this way the native reserves were sure to be well
                                                scattered among the lands occupied and owned by White men, and of fair
                                                average value. This system held out the brightest hopes of success: the
                                                value of the lands was thus secured, and it was also provided that such
                                                portions as the natives might select for their residence should be
                                                interspersed among the residences of White men, instead of being so
                                                isolated as to preserve their rude and uncivilized habits. Nothing can
                                                be a more degrading sight than the exclusively Indian villages of
                                                Canada. The defective habits and inclinations of the savage are
                                                preserved, and his existence as an isolated and inferior being is
                                                encouraged and perpetuated. They are visited as curiosities by the White
                                                inhabitants and travellers, and are preserved in that light, like wild
                                                beasts in a show, devoid of comfort or improvement. The miserable
                                                appearance of the native villages which we had seen in New Zealand,
                                                tended in the strongest manner to confirm these views. Crowded together,
                                                as the natives were, in small, filthy, and unwholesome huts, we found
                                                that the animal heat, unpurified by ventilation, forced them to sleep
                                                quite naked, and that</p>

                                            <p class="div1"> both sexes and all ages lay thus huddled together, like
                                                dormice in a nest. Without a great reform in this particular no one,
                                                however well-disposed to do so, could hope to effect a change in their
                                                morals, or to raise them up to the level of White people. In order that
                                                they should be better and more decently clothed, it was necessary that
                                                an improved process of agriculture should enable them to produce more
                                                than they consumed, without taking all their time; so that they might
                                                set aside some hours for the cultivation of their intellect and their
                                                religious education.</p>
                                            <p class="div1"> It was hoped that these preliminary changes, absolutely
                                                necessary to their effectual civilization, and yet mere steps towards
                                                that end, might be in a great measure assisted by means of dispersing
                                                their residences and their cultivations among those of the superior
                                                race, because the constant example before their eyes, and consequent
                                                emulation to attain the same results, would naturally lead the inferior
                                                race, by an easy ascent, to a capacity for acquiring the knowledge,
                                                habits, desires, and comforts, of their civilized neighbours.</p>
                                            <p class="div1"> This was what many sincere well-wishers to the natives had
                                                contemplated in their opinion, expressed in England before we left, that
                                                civilization should go hand in hand with, and in some degree precede
                                                Christianity among savage tribes. Perhaps the most interesting part of
                                                our undertaking was our acquiescence in this principle, and the interest
                                                which we felt in calculating on its expediency from what we observed of
                                                the natives while in their wildest state.</p>

                                                political economist, did not see the whole bearing on our theory of the
                                                system of native reserves; but he agreed that it was a noble and just

                                            <p class="div1"> We looked much further; and considered the real payment to

                                            distinct sound to each vowel, similar to that which it would have in the
                                            Continental languages. Thus <i>maori</i> is sounded like "mowree;"
