        <h2> CHAPTER II.</h2>
        <h3>Departure Of First Expedition.</h3>

        <div class="jerningham"> ALL our equipments and preparations being at length complete, we sailed from Plymouth
            on
            the
            12th of May.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> The ship was commanded by Mr. Edmund Mein Chaffers, of the Royal Navy, who had been
            acting
            master of H. M. S. Beagle during the survey of Cape Horn and voyage round the world, performed by
            Captain
            Fitzroy between the years. 1830 and 1836.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Besides Colonel Wakefield and myself, the following gentlemen were passengers
            on board:
            --Doctor Ernest Dieffenbach, a native of Berlin, who had been appointed naturalist to the Company;
            Mr.
            Charles
            Heaphy, the Company's draughtsman; Mr. John Dorset, who had been promised the appointment of
            colonial
            surgeon;
            Nayti, a New Zealander, who had been residing during two years in my father's house in London, and
            who was
            to
            act as interpreter; Mr. Richard Lowry, the chief mate; and Mr. George F.
            Robinson, the surgeon of the ship.
            The
            Rev. Montague Hawtrey, to whom I have already adverted as the writer of the admirable essay on the
            amalgamation
            of a civilized people with savages, was to have accompanied us as chaplain. He had actually received
            his
            outfit
            allowance from the Company, but was prevented at the last moment by unavoidable
            circumstances from carrying out his intentions.</div>
        <div class="simon">There's not much information on this "Nayti" character. The 1940 edition of the
            New Zealand
            Dictionary of Biography has him "born about 1812", and arriving in France on a whaling ship.
            From France he
            was taken to England and apparently lived with Wakefield for a time, helping to promote his
            schemes. Some
            sources give his name as "Te Whaiti", while others suggest "Ngati".<br><br>
            While in England he also gave some statements to a select committee of the House of Lords, and
            was featured
            in an article in "The Saturday Magazine", where he was pictured looking quite dapper.<br>

        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> In the steerage were--Robert Doddrey, who had formerly visited some
            parts of the coast of
            New
            Zealand in a trading schooner from Van Diemen's Land, and who was engaged as storekeeper and
            additional
            interpreter; the second and third mates; and Colonel Wakefield's servant, besides the
            steward and his
            cabin-boys.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Petty officers and foremast hands, among whom were a New Zealander
            and a native of the
            Marquesas Islands, made up our total muster-roll to thirty-five souls.</div>
        <h3>Voyage--First Sight Of New Zealand.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> The Tory sailed remarkably well. We crossed the line, in 26
            deg. 50' W. longitude, on the
            twenty-sixth day from Plymouth, passed the longitude of the Cape of Good Hope on the
            10th of July, and saw
            the
            high land of New Zealand on the 16th of August, about noon. We established during
            the voyage a weekly
            manuscript
            newspaper, and a debating society. These recreations, and an ample supply of useful
            and interesting books,
            caused the time to pass cheerfully enough. Vocabularies of the <i>Maori</i> or New
            Zealand language were
            also
            constructed from Nayti's dictation; and lessons to him in English spelling, many a
            deep game of chess, and
            an
            occasional <i>battue</i> <button class="inline" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#info1"
                aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="info1">i</button>
            <div id="info1" class="info collapse width">This is a French word which means "shooting party".
            </div>
            of the albatrosses and other marine
            birds, which
            abound in
            the high latitudes
            between
            the Cape of Good Hope and Van Diemen's Land, beguiled the leisure time. These
            <i>battues</i> partook of
            shooting
            and fishing; for sometimes we baited large hooks with bits of pork, and caught the
            gigantic birds by the
            beak. I
            remember one day seeing twenty-eight live albatrosses on the deck together, many of
            them measuring twelve
            feet
            from tip to tip of the wings. Once on the deck, they cannot escape, as they have
            great
            difficulty in first rising on the wing. Some of us stored the white feathers,
            supposing from Nayti's account
            that they would be highly valuable in New Zealand; others made tobacco-pouches of
            the web-feet, or
            pipe-stems of
            the wing-bones; the naturalist made preparations of skeletons and skins, to keep his
            hand in; and the
            sailors
            prepared the carcases in a dish called "sea-pie."
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> The land which we first sighted proved to be the western
            coast of the Middle Island, not
            far
            south of Cape Farewell. A remarkable white fissure in the mountains forms a
            distinguishing land-mark at a
            great
            distance.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Having fairly entered the middle of Cook's Strait by
            sunset, we hove to with a fresh N.
            W.
            breeze till daylight. Once or twice during the night we found soundings in
            about fifty fathoms. This was
            conjectured to be near the mouth of Blind Bay.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> In the morning of the 17th we proceeded to the
            eastward. When I came on deck we had land
            in
            sight on both bows. Bearing away for the southern land, we soon made out
            Stephens Island, and passed within
            five
            or six miles of it. As we ran along the coast, D'Urville's Island, the
            Admiralty Islands, Point Lambert, and
            Point Jackson were successively recognized from Cook's chart. The high
            rugged land of the Middle Island,
            which
            had at a distance appeared barren and sprinkled with rocks, proved on
            closer inspection to be clothed with
            the
            most luxuriant forest. As we neared Point Jackson, the breeze died away,
            and we remained for a time becalmed
            in
            the entrance of Queen Charlotte's Sound. Cape <i>Koumaru</i> <a href="#note1" id="note_ref1">

        <div id="info3" class="info collapse width">
            "Entry Island" is a now disused name for Kapiti Island. In following the coast around into Wellington Harbour, European ships would pass between Kapiti and the mainland, using the island as a landmark.
        </div>, and the
            mainland on the north coast of Cook's
            Strait, were now very distinctly visible; a bright warm sun gave the
            most charming appearance to the
            romantic
            shores of the Sound; and we exclaimed against the calm which seemed
            likely to detain us another night at
            sea.
            Two or three of the most impatient got into the cutter, and pulled
            towards Point Jackson, to try and catch
            some
            fish; but they had not got far before a light air sprang up, and we
            glided into the Sound. The tide
            favouring
            us, they had some trouble in overtaking the ship. The scenery became
            more and more majestic as we advanced
            into
            this noble estuary. Its outer mouth is nine miles wide. High wooded
            mountains rise on both sides; numerous
            islands and projecting points dot the expanse of still water which
            penetrates far into the interior; and a
            glimpse of the Southern Alps is obtained in the extreme distance. We
            proceeded between Long Island and
            <i>Motuara.</i> The former, a narrow ridge bare of wood, was crowned
            with native fortifications; a small
            <i>pa</i> or fort was also visible on the south point of <i>Motuara.</i>
            As we entered the Sound, we saw
            four
            canoes under sail, coming from the westward. Before we anchored for the
            night in the S. E. entrance of Ship
            Cove, another canoe came paddling off to us, containing eight natives.
            We at first thought they hesitated
            about
            venturing near us; but it turned out that they were only stopping to
            bale out their canoe, which was a very
            ill-constructed affair. As they came alongside the ship, which had
            almost stopped her way, the canoe was
            lashed to the chains, and the men scrambled on deck with great activity.
            We were at first startled by the
            quickness with which this was done, and by their wild, half-naked
            appearance. All our anticipations had not
            prepared us thoroughly for this first meeting; and our friend Nayti was
            so quiet and silent in his manners,
            that
            the contrast of their demeanour was striking. They ran about shaking
            hands with everybody they met, and
            seemed
            to consider their appearance as a matter of course. One of them, a tall
            muscular young man, ran to assist
            the
            helmsman, and seemed proud to display some knowledge of nautical terms
            and the manoeuvres of a ship. They
            all
            spoke more or less broken English, and chattered in a sort of
            authoritative way about the best anchorage,
            giving
            themselves quite the airs belonging to a pilot. They had brought on
            board some fish and potatoes, which we
            bought for a little tobacco. Night closed in as we let go our anchor,
            and they returned to their village.

        <h3>Queen Charlotte's Sound-Natives.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> August 18th. --This morning, at daylight, we
            had warped farther into the cove, and
            anchored
            in 11 fathoms, muddy bottom, within 300 yards of the shore, where we
            fastened a hawser to a tree; thus
            occupying
            probably the same spot as Captain Cook, in his numerous visits to
            this harbour. There were a good many
            natives
            on board already; but, eager to touch the land, I got into a small
            canoe with Nayti, who paddled me ashore.
            The
            hills, which rise to the height of 1000 or 1500 feet on three sides
            of the cove, are covered from their tops
            to
            the water's edge with an undulating carpet of forest. How well Cook
            has described the harmony of the birds
            at
            this very spot! Every bough seemed to throng with feathered
            musicians, and the melodious chimes of the
            bell-bird
            were especially dis-tinct. At the head of the cove is a small level
            space of land, formed by the alluvial
            deposit
            of three rills from the mountains, which here empty themselves into
            the bay. Landing here, I remained for
            some
            time absorbed in contemplating the luxurious vegeta-tion of grass
            and shrubs, and the wild carrots and
            turnips
            which remain as relics of our great navigator. Rich historical
            recollections crowded on my mind as I tried
            to
            fix on the exact spot where Cook's forge and carpenter's shop had
            stood; and I was only roused from my
            reverie
            by the arrival of some more of the party, bent on the same object.
            We collected some shells, pebbles, and
            plants, and returned to breakfast on fresh potatoes and some of the
            fish which had been caught in abundance
            from
            the ship in the evening.</div>
        <div class="simon">
            <p>We haven't learnt much about our narrator, Edward Jerningham Wakefield (he went by "Jerningham" his whole life, to distinguish himself from his
                father, Edward Gibbon Wakefield). At this point, there's not much to learn about him, since Jerningham is only 19 years old.</p>
                <p>He completed school at King's College in London, and has already accompanied his father on 
                a journey to Canada in 1838 (his father was assisting Lord Durham to compile a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham_Report">report on the Canadian Rebellions</a>). Jerningham acted as his father's clerk and secretary.

        <h3>Ship Cove-Natives.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> The four canoes which we had seen yesterday
            arrived this morning, and came alongside the
            ship. They came from Admiralty Bay, and were bound to Cloudy
            Bay, with pigs and potatoes for sale. Having
            seen
            us stand in, they came in hopes of having a deal with us; and
            they also told us that they were going through
            the
            Sound, thus confirming Nayti's previous account that its eastern
            side consisted of an island. They had not
            abandoned any of their savage customs, and rubbed noses with
            Nayti instead of shaking him by the hand. They
            were
            also covered with oil and red ochre, and seemed much wilder in
            their manners than our friends of Ship Cove.
            These latter informed us that they had been lately visited by a
            missionary schooner, and that they shook
            hands
            because they were all "missionaries." We could not, however,
            discover whether Wesleyan or Church
            missionaries
            had converted them; and we soon found that they were not yet
            very attentive even to the forms of the new
            doctrine. They all wished to barter, although this was Sunday;
            and seemed much surprised that Colonel
            Wakefield
            declined the offer of one of their daughters
            to remain on board with him. This was no doubt owing to the
            vicinity of the whale-ships and whaling-stations
            in
            and near Cloudy Bay. They were all, however, told to return
            ashore, and bring what they had to sell the next
            day.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> We went ashore again after prayers, and
            admired the luxurious vegetation. The wood on the
            sides of the hills appeared almost impenetrable from the
            thick web of supple-jacks and creepers. We found no
            natives, the cove being under <i>tapu,</i> on account of its
            being the burial-place of a daughter of <i>Te
                Pehi,</i> the late chief of the <i>Kapiti,</i> or Entry
            Island, natives. Those who visited us came from
            a
            cove a little farther north, called Cannibal Cove by Cook,
            and <i>Anaho</i> by the natives. They are called
            the
            <i>Ngatihinatui</i> tribe, and their principal chief was
            named <i>Ngarewa,</i> or "The Straight Trees."</div>
        <div class="simon">
            <p>Jerningham doesn't mention it, but Te Pehi had actually been to England himself, in 1824, and had his
                portrait painted there. Te Pehi was an instrumental ally of Te Rauperaha and Te Rangihaeata (who we'll
                meet
                shortly) in the capture
                of Kapiti island from Muaūpoko and Ngāti Apa.</p>
                <p>Te Pehi was killed in a Ngāi Tahu ambush while accompanying Te Rauperaha and Te Rangihaeata on an expedition to the South Island. (<a

        <div class="jerningham"> August 19th. --The work of filling
            our water-casks and refitting the ship commenced
            to-day.
            The storekeeper was very busy laying in a stock of
            potatoes and pigs from the natives. A pipe bought a
            basket of
            potatoes weighing 20 lbs., and a red blanket bought
            three good-sized pigs. These terms, too, were considered
            liberal on our part. In the afternoon we went over in
            the boat to <i>Motuara,</i> the island on which Cook
            had
            his observatory and garden. It commands a fine view of
            the northern part of the Sound, Entry Island, and the
            high land near Cape <i>Terawiti.</i> The island had a
            very gay appearance, being covered with wild shrubs
            and
            flowers like an ornamental plantation. We fell in with
            plenty of pigeons, parrots, and other birds, which
            our
            guns soon made to contribute to the table and to the
            collection of the delighted naturalist.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> None of the natives live here;
            but they turn pigs loose on the island, and catch
            them as
            they
            are wanted.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> The chief <i>Ngarewa,</i>
            with his wife, and his son <i>Ehoro,</i> a nice
            intelligent lad
            of
            thirteen, remained to dinner with us to-day.
            Their behaviour was very re-spectable: they ate
            heartily of
            everything, but drank little, the father warning
            <i>Ehoro</i> against too much wine.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Nayti seemed much
            pleased at our kind treatment of his
            countrymen. He was at first
            ashamed of
            their rude appearance, and often apologised
            to us for it. He seemed, too, suspicious and
            afraid of them, and
            inclined to cling to us in consequence.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> During the next few
            days we made great friends with the
            natives. The barter went on
            alongside; <i>Ngarewa</i> remained on
            deck or in the cabin amusing himself
            with a pipe and a book of prints,
            or
            trying to understand and answer our
            inquiries about his place and people. He
            did not appear to have much
            influence on the latter, and at any rate
            never exerted it. <i>Ehoro</i> guided us
            on shooting excursions up
            the
            sides of the hills, or joined our
            fishing parties to the next cove to the
            south, where we always had a good
            haul
            with our sean. The women of the village
            had almost all removed to Ship Cove,
            where they eagerly undertook
            the
            task of washing our clothes.</div>
        <h3>Wretched Houses--Dispute.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> On the 22nd we
            took <i>Ngarewa</i> home to his
            village in our whale-boat, after he
            had
            received from my uncle a gun and
            some other small presents. We found
            the village of <i>Anaho</i> in a
            level
            piece of ground at the head of
            Cannibal Cove, and were much amused
            by seeing the <i>ware puni,</i> or
            sleeping
            houses, of the natives. These are
            exceedingly low; and covered with
            earth, on which weeds very often
            grow.
            They
            resemble, in shape and size, a
            hot-bed with the glass off. A small
            square hole at one end is the only
            passage
            for light or air. I intended to
            creep into one of
            them to examine it; but had just got
            my head in, and was debating within
            myself by what snake-like evolution
            I
            should best succeed in getting my
            body to follow, when I was deterred
            by the intense heat and intolerable
            odour
            from proceeding. One large house in
            the village, with wattled walls
            plastered with clay, we were told
            belonged
            to an Englishman then in Cloudy Bay.
            The natives use it for a common
            habitation during the day, and
            assemble
            in
            it to prayers every morning and
            evening. They all came out to greet
            us with the constant shake of the
            hand.
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> A
            mischief-making native,
            belonging to the <i>Kapiti</i>
            tribe, but who has married a
            woman
            here, tried to annoy us by
            threats and extortions of
            payment for wood and water, on
            account of the
            <i>tapu</i>
            of Ship Cove. As, however, his
            demands were exorbitant, and
            renewed after the satisfactory
            settlement of the
            point by a small present, he was
            quietly and firmly refused by my
            uncle; who reminded him that the
            natives
            had
            themselves broken the
            <i>tapu,</i> large numbers of
            them having removed to the
            immediate neighbourhood of
            the
            burial-place in order to have
            the advantage of proximity in
            their dealings with us. He
            persisted in his
            violent
            demands; and early one morning
            came alongside in a canoe, and
            carried away our fishing-sean,
            having first
            pushed
            over one of the apprentices who
            was in the boat. Captain
            Chaffers went on shore with an
            armed boat to demand
            instant restitution of the net;
            and found that our tormentor had
            enlisted the feelings of the
            other natives
            in
            his favour. They were sullen and
            reserved, and refused to give it
            up at first. Their appearance,
            and the
            fact
            that many fresh natives were
            ashore, induced Captain Chaffers
            to return on hoard, and prepare
            the ship for
            an
            emergency. The guns were
            shotted, the crew
            armed, sentries placed at the
            gangways, and a spring put on
            the cable so that the ship's
            broadside might be
            brought to bear on the beach
            where the natives were encamped.
            During these preparations, one
            or two large
            war-canoes came round the
            northern point of the cove, and
            dashed in to the beach at great
            speed, the rowers
            singing in time with their
            paddles. A single canoe, full of
            natives, now came off to the
            ship. As they
            silently
            paddled round the stern, we
            observed that some carried their
            tomahawks and green-stone clubs
            or <i>meri
                ponamu</i> <button class="inline" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#info2"
                aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="info2">i</button>
            <div id="info2" class="info collapse width">
                <p>"Meri" here is, of course, "mere" in modern orthography.
                    Jerningham uses "tomahawk" frequently also, I believe in reference to stone or wooden patu of
                    various
                    kinds. It's
                    possible also that steel or iron hatchets obtained in trade were popular weapons at this time.</p>
                <p>It's interesting how often Jerningham reports seeing mere pounamu specifically, as these are
                    generally considered rare and chiefly weapons, some taking <i>multiple generations</i> to create.
                    It's possible that he is mistaking ordinary stone weapons for the more precious pounamu variety.</p>
            </div>. The others kept
            their blankets and mats wrapped
            over everything but their heads.
            Our
            original
            persecutor was the first who
            attempted to ascend the ladder,
            tomahawk in hand; but he was
            startled to find
            at
            the top a sentry with musket and
            bayonet, and my uncle, who
            quietly but firmly told him to
            go ashore, and
            that
            he would allow no natives to
            come on board armed. "Dogskin,"
            as we had nick- named him from
            his wearing a
            mat of
            that material, seemed inclined
            to persist in his intention of
            getting on deck; but the sight
            of the end of a
            pistol sticking out of my
            uncle's coat-pocket suddenly
            made him change his mind; and he
            descended into the
            canoe, which pulled slowly back
            to the shore. A smaller canoe
            next came off, with only a boy
            paddling, and
            an
            old chief whom we had not yet
            seen, who showed that he was
            unarmed, and requested to be
            allowed to come on
            board. This was complied with;
            and the old gentleman introduced
            himself as <i>Te Wetu,</i> or
            "the Star." He
            told us that he came from
            <i>Rangitoto,</i> which we
            afterwards discovered to be in
            D'Urville's Island, and
            that
            he was waiting in a bay north of
            Cannibal Cove for fair weather
            to cross the strait to
            <i>Kapiti,</i> in
            order
            to be present at a grand
            <i>tangi,</i> or mourning feast,
            over the
            death of a sister of
            <i>Rauperaha,</i> the great
            chief at that place<button class="inline" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#info3"
                aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="info3">i</button>
            <div id="info3" class="info collapse width">
                <p>Jerningham consistently spells Te Rauparaha as just "Rauperaha" which is interesting, because he
                    includes the definite article in some other names. I don't know if this is his mistake, or due to
                    inconsistent usage at the time.</p>
            </div>. He
            explained to us that every one
            would
            cry very much, and that then
            there would be much <i>kai
                kai</i> or feasting. He was
            accompanied by a large
            retinue; some of whom had come
            with him in the morning to visit
            the <i>Ngatihinatui.</i> The
            war-canoes
            belonged
            to his party. He seemed much
            inclined to stop on board, and
            talked to us of the quarrel with
            great
            indifference.
            He asserted, though, that we
            ought to pay for the
            <i>tapu,</i> but suggested as an
            amendment, that the
            <i>utu,</i> or "payment," should
            be handed to him instead of
            "Dogskin." We therefore
            concluded that the
            demand
            was altogether unjust, and a
            mere bullying attempt at
            extortion, <i>Te Wetu</i>
            appeared to be about sixty
            years
            old, but he was still wiry and
            strong. He was
            very amusing and fond of
            conversation. He told us all
            about his place,
            <i>Rangitoto,</i> which means
            "blood-coloured sky," and
            expressed his hope that we
            should pay it a visit. He
            declared himself "no
            missionary,"
            and said he had four wives, the
            fifth having lately died. Having
            inquired how many the Kings of
            England had,
            he
            laughed heartily at finding that
            they were not so well provided,
            and repeatedly counted "four
            <i>wahine</i>"
            (women) on his fingers. We gave
            the natives a small present of
            tobacco, recovered the sean, and
            soon
            restored
            friendship, as they had become
            tired of being excluded from
            their market on board. <i>Te
                Wetu</i> took
            kindly to
            the cabin-table, where covers
            were always laid for him and
            <i>Ngarewa's</i> family, who had
            taken no part
            whatever in the disturbances.
            The natives were rather puzzled
            at our display of force, and my
            uncle's
            firmness
            on the occasion excited general
            respect among them. They had
            previously described us as a
            missionary ship;
            many
            of them having taken notice of
            our observance of the Sunday,
            and some having attended
            our service on that day. They
            now, however, said we were
            half-missionary, half-soldier. A
            native missionary
            teacher, named William,
            assembled the natives who were
            on board to prayers several
            evenings. <i>Te Wetu</i>
            always sat apart when this took
            place. No further attempts at
            extortion were made; and <i>Te
                Wetu</i> told a
            canoe-full of his people, who
            attempted to come on board one
            morning, that they were not
            wanted, and that he
            was
            very comfortable where he was.

        <h3>European
            Settlement--Mountains.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> On the
            28th, my uncle sent Doddrey
            the store-keeper, with a
            native guide, to a village
            at
            the
            southern entrance of Queen
            Charlotte's Sound, which
            Nayti and also the resident
            natives described as
            containing
            a hundred White men, with
            three <i>rangatira,</i> or
            "chiefs." In the afternoon
            of the following day, he
            returned in a whale-boat
            with two Englishmen. One was
            named Williams, and was
            carpenter at the village in
            question, where he said
            there were about sixty
            Europeans or Americans
            living by whaling. The other
            was named
            Arthur, and owned the
            meeting-house in
            <i>Anaho</i> village. Both
            brought their native wives
            with them. That
            of
            Arthur belongs to the
            village, and he generally
            lives there in the summer.
            It was now, however, the
            season
            for
            whaling, in which pursuit we
            learnt that he was engaged;
            and he was in consequence
            living at
            <i>Te-awa-iti,</i>
            whence the boat came.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> The
            crew of the whale-boat
            consisted of young
            native men, dressed in
            the costume of
            European
            seamen; and we heard
            that a great many of
            them are employed in the
            boats by the whalers.
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham">
            The arrival of our
            countrymen produced
            a great change in
            the deportment of
            the natives.
            They
            now cringed to our
            new guests, who took
            but little notice of
            them; and the
            obnoxious "Dogskin"
            disappeared.
            The
            new-comers confirmed
            our idea that the
            demand of utu<i></i>
            was a mere
            extortion, and were
            much amused at the
            relation of our
            alarm and warlike
            demonstration. They
            told us that the
            natives were always
            ready to take
            advantage of
            inexperienced
            visitors

            this way.</div>

            nothing here
            towards
            attaining our

            was to select

            suitable for the
            emigrants whom

            follow us in
            January. Neither
            <i>Ngarewa</i>
            nor
            <i>Te
                Wetu</i>
            could give us
            any distinct
            information as
            to the ownership
            of the land in
            this
            neighbourhood.
            They
            both spoke of
            <i>Rauperaha</i>
            as the great
            chieftain to
            whom they were
            in a measure
            tributary; but
            they
            seemed
            to agree that
            <i>Hiko,</i> the
            son of <i>Te
                Pehi,</i>
            had the best
            right to the
            land here.
            Neither,
            however,
            was
            described as
            having an
            absolute right
            to dispose of
            land; and the
            vested rights
            appeared to us
            to be
            involved in
            much confusion.
            Our White
            friends could
            not clear up our
            doubts; and,
            moreover, it was
            plain that
            although
            the
            immediate
            vicinity of Ship
            Cove could boast
            of excellent
            harbours and
            sublime scenery,
            it was not at
            all
            suited
            for a large
            European colony.
            My uncle
            therefore
            determined to
            avail himself of
            the services of
            Williams and
            Arthur in
            piloting the
            vessel to
            <i>Te-awa-iti,</i>
            where we might
            acquire more
            information.</div>
        <div class="jerningham">
            While we
            remained at
            anchor in
            Ship Cove,
            Dr.
            Dieffenbach
            had ascended
            two of the
            hills
            which
            bound the
            bay. On the
            first
            expedition
            he was
            accompanied
            by the
            artist and
            <i>Ehoro.</i>
            They emerged
            from
            the
            forest into
            a coppice of
            fern, ten
            feet high,
            which
            clothed the
            upper part
            of the hill.
            After a
            tedious
            scramble
            through
            this, they
            reached the
            summit, and
            were
            rewarded by
            a panoramic
            view of the
            numerous
            bays and
            coves
            of
            Queen
            Charlotte's
            Sound,
            dotted with
            many
            islands, and
            the northern
            shore of
            Cook's
            Strait. They
            calculated
            the
            hill
            to be 800
            feet above
            the level of
            the sea. The
            second hill
            he ascended
            with a
            native guide
            only. He
            obtained
            no
            view from
            the summit,
            as it was
            covered with
            the loftiest
            forest-trees.
            He
            ascertained
            the height
            by boiling
            water to be
            upwards of
            1500 feet.
            His guide
            was a good
            deal
            frightened,
            and tried to
            dissuade him
            from
            proceeding,
            before they
            had
            completed
            the ascent,
            by legends
            of fierce
            monsters
            whom they
            would be
            sure to
            meet.
            On one
            occasion I
            formed one
            of a party
            who ascended
            the hill to
            a
            considerable
            height, by
            the course
            of one
            of
            the streams.
            We climbed
            up the sides
            of some
            picturesque
            waterfalls,
            and attained
            the top of a
            ridge
            covered
            with the
            largest
            trees. The
            trunks of
            some of
            these
            reached to
            the height
            of seventy
            or eighty
            feet without
            a
            branch. This
            elevated
            part of the
            forest was
            almost free
            from
            underwood,
            and moreover
            quite
            silent, the
            birds
            appearing to
            remain in
            the lower
            and more
            lively
            regions. It
            was
            impossible
            not to be
            struck by
            the majesty
            of
            this
            primaeval
            forest.</div>

            August
            31.
            --The
            weather,
            which
            had been
            very
            boisterous,
            with
            much
            rain,
            during
            the last
            few
            days,
            cleared
            up this
            morning.
            Having
            completed
            most of
            our
            refittings,
            and laid
            in a
            good
            stock of
            potatoes
            and
            water,
            we
            weighed
            anchor
            at 10 in
            the
            morning,
            and
            stood up
            the
            Sound
            with a
            light
            wind and
            favouring
            tide.
            We
            bade
            adieu to
            our
            friends
            the
            natives,
            and set
            <i>Te
                Wetu</i>
            and
            <i>Ngarewa</i>
            ashore
            as we
            got
            under
            way.
            We
            were,
            however,
            accompanied
            by the
            native
            teacher
            William,
            and by
            the
            native
            who had
            sprung
            to the
            wheel on
            our
            first
            arrival.
            The
            latter,
            whose
            native
            name was
            <i>E
                Ware,</i>
            had made
            himself
            a
            general
            favourite
            on
            board,
            and had
            apparently
            taken a
            fancy to
            the
            ship;
            for he
            installed
            himself
            among
            the men
            without
            any
            agreement,
            and
            joined
            in all
            the work
            without
            any
            recompense
            but his
            meals
            and a
            little
            tobacco.
            His
            activity
            and
            mirth,
            together
            with the
            rich
            humour
            which he
            displayed
            in
            executing
            some of
            the
            native
            dances,
            as well
            as in
            mimicking
            almost
            every
            one on
            board,
            earned
            for him
            the
            sobriquet
            of "Jim
            Crow,"
            which he
            retained
            during
            the
            whole
            time
            that he
            stuck to
            the
            ship. He
            had
            acquired
            his
            nautical
            knowledge
            on
            board a
            whaling-ship
            in which
            he had
            served.
            I have
            often
            seen
            him, in
            the
            violent
            gales
            which we
            weathered
            on
            various
            parts of
            the
            coast,
            out on
            the end
            of the
            yard-arm
            doing
            the work
            of the
            best man
            in
            reefing,
            and
            cheering
            the
            sailors
            to
            exertion
            by some
            broad
            joke or
            irresistible
            grimace.
            He was
            fully
            competent
            to do
            the
            work of
            an able
            seaman;
            and his
            good
            humour
            under
            all
            circumstances
            was
            invincible.

            as
            we
            christened
            the
            hill
            which
            the
            naturalist
            ascended
            without
            falling
            a
            victim
            to
            the
            fabulous
            genii
            of
            the
            place.
            Nothing
            can
            be
            imagined
            more
            magnificent
            than
            the
            scenery,
            or,
            however,
            less
            suitable
            for
            cultivation.
            It
            forcibly
            reminded
            me
            of
            the
            wildest
            parts
            of
            the
            Highlands
            of
            the
            Hudson,
            with
            a
            greater
            expanse
            of
            water.
            At 3
            p.
            m.
            we
            reached
            the
            entrance
            of
            the
            channel
            which
            joins
            the
            Sound
            with
            Cook's
            Strait
            to
            the
            eastward.
            The
            entrance
            is
            about
            a
            mile
            wide;
            and
            the
            channel,
            which
            was
            christened
            Tory
            Channel
            after
            Captain
            Chaffers
            had
            surveyed
            it,
            turns
            first
            to
            the east,
            and
            then
            to
            the
            north-east,
            thus
            insulating
            but
            a
            narrow
            strip
            of
            land,
            and
            running
            nearly
            parallel
            to
            the
            Sound
            for
            the
            greater
            part
            of
            its
            course.
            As
            we
            left
            the
            main
            arm
            of
            Queen
            Charlotte's
            Sound,
            we
            saw
            at
            its
            southern
            end,
            some
            six
            or
            seven
            miles
            from
            us,
            a
            tract
            of
            level
            land
            apparently
            two
            or
            three
            miles
            wide,
            from
            which
            a
            grove
            of
            high
            trees
            rose
            up.

            The

            of
            the

            was
            heightened
            by
            the

            clearness
            of
            the

            The

            shone
            forth

            outline
            and
            brilliant
            colours.
            When
            we
            were
            at
            Ship
            Cove,
            the

            edge
            of
            Entry
            Island,
            which

            thirty
            miles
            distant,
            was
            generally
            plain
            to
            the
            eye,
            relieved
            against

            of
            the
            North
            Island.
            As
            we
            entered
            into
            the
            narrow
            channel,
            the
            wind
            died
            away;
            but
            a
            tide,
            running
            four
            or
            five
            knots
            an
            hour,
            drifted
            us
            along.
            Eddies
            were
            formed
            on
            the
            shores,
            and
            we
            were
            obliged
            to
            have
            boats
            towing
            a-head
            in
            order

            the
            ship
            in
            mid-channel.
            In
            most
            parts
            of
            the
            sound

            thirty

            fathoms,
            even
            close

            the

            the
            numerous
            bays
            afford
            more
            secure
            anchorage,
            out
            of
            the
            influence
            of
            the
            tide.
            About
            half-way
            through
            the
            channel
            a
            small
            island
            lies
            in
            the
            mouth
            of
            one
            of
            these
            bays,
            crowned
            by
            the
            palisadoes
            of
            a
            native
            fort.
            The
            inhabitants
            eyed
            us
            eagerly
            from
            the
            shore,
            and
            one
            or
            two
            canoes
            approached
            the
            ship.
            They
            seemed
            cautious
            of
            too
            near
            intercourse.
            This
            was
            soon
            explained
            to
            us
            by
            our
            pilots.
            In
            the
            year
            1838,
            the
            Pelorus,
            English
            brig-of-war,
            visited
            different
            parts
            of
            Cook's
            Strait,
            and
            did
            great
            service
            here
            by
            rendering
            justice
            to
            the
            injured
            party
            in
            many
            cases
            where
            complaint
            was
            made
            to
            the
            commander.
            After
            a
            display
            of
            gunnery
            close

            obtained
            restitution
            of
            many
            articles
            stolen
            from
            the
            whalers
            for
            a
            long
            space
            back.
            The
            chief,
            named
            <i>Huriwenua,</i>
            and
            his
            people,
            had
            distinguished
            themselves
            by
            their
            dishonesty
            and
            harassing
            conduct
            towards
            the
            Whites,
            and
            some
            of
            the
            guns
            were
            in
            consequence
            pointed
            against
            a
            stack
            of
            wood
            for
            fencing,
            which
            they
            knocked
            to
            pieces.
            This
            harmless
            show
            of
            strength
            produced
            an
            excellent
            effect;
            and
            the
            visit
            was
            so
            recent
            that
            their
            respect
            for
            our
            flag
            still
            existed.
            This
            fortified
            island
            is

            We
            had
            been
            highly
            amused
            at

            What
            was
            our

            on

            person
            as
            he
            was
            shorter!
            Dressed
            in
            a
            white
            jacket,
            blue
            dungaree
            trousers,
            and
            round
            straw
            hat,
            he
            seemed
            perfectly
            round
            all
            over;
            while
            his
            jovial,
            ruddy
            face,
            twinkling
            eyes,
            and
            good-humoured
            smile,
            could
            not
            fail
            to
            excite
            pleasure
            in
            all
            beholders.
            And
            a
            merry
            party
            it
            was
            to
            look
            upon,
            as
            we
            sat
            round
            a
            bottle
            of
            grog
            on
            the
            cabin-table,
            listening
            to
            the
            relation
            of
            the
            wild

                <p>Here Jerningham goes on to give some detail of the recent history of the Queen Charlotte's Sound and Kapiti area. What he's describing is the tail end of a huge
                    southward migration of several allied northern iwi, known as "Te Heke Mai-i-raro" or "The Migration from the North". Te Ara has <a href="https://teara.govt.nz/en/ngati-toarangatira">
                    a detailed account</a>. Ngāti Toa and their allies (including Te Āti Awa and Ngāti Raukawa) migrated south to avoid conflicts with Waikato iwi. They eventually settled
                    on both sides of Cook Strait, with the seat of their power on Kapiti island. Part of the attraction to this region was the population of Pakeha whalers which promised to be a valuable
                    source of muskets and other trade goods.</p> 
                    <p>
                        At the time of the Tory's arrival, the region is still in a highly unsettled state, with complex alliances among Te Rauparaha's group, 
                        ongoing conflicts with the original inhabitants of the region (including Rangitāne, Muaūpoko, Ngāti Kuia and Ngāti Apa) who had never ceded ownership, 
                        and pressures from Ngāi Tahu in the south. This complex political backdrop will become extremely relevant as the New Zealand Company attempts to purchase land in the region.

            his
            constant
            intercourse
            with
            them
            had
            produced
            in
            him
            a
            worthy
            admiration
            of
            the
            good
            points
            in
            their
            character.
            He
            knew
            them
            too
            well,
            however,
            to
            give
            them
            unlimited
            praise;
            but
            was
            delighted
            at
            the
            prospect
            of
            a
            regular
            English
            colony,
            which
            might
            cherish
            and
            benefit
            them,
            while
            it
            should
            prevent
            the
            disastrous
            effects
            often
            arising
            from
            the
            intercourse
            between
            the
            most
            ill-disposed
            among
            them,
            and
            some
            of
            their
            White
            guests
            who,
            outlaws
            from
            civilized
            society,
            had
            degenerated
            into
            something
            more
            brutal
            than
            the
            savage.
            We
            also
            learnt
            from
            him
            in
            how
            unsettled
            a
            state
            was
            the
            proprietorship
            of
            land
            about
            Cook's
            Strait.
            The
            country
            had
            been
            conquered
            about
            fourteen
            years
            before
            by
            the
            <i>Kawia</i>
            tribe.
            They
            had
            almost
            exterminated
            the
            <i>Muopoko,
                Rangitane,</i>
            and
            <i>Ngatiapa,</i>
            who
            were
            the
            original
            occupiers.
            And
            even
            the
            spots
            now
            occupied
            were
            in
            dispute
            between
            the
            conquerors
            and
            the
            <i>Ngatiawa,</i>
            who
            followed
            nine
            years
            afterwards
            in
            their
            track.
            The
            very
            superior
            number
            of
            the
            <i>Ngatiawa</i>
            seemed
            to
            constitute
            their
            only
            right
            to
            supplant
            the
            conquerors.
            We
            learned
            that
            a
            war
            in
            consequence
            of
            some
            such
            dispute
            had
            been
            only
            recently
            concluded
            in
            the
            north
            end
            of
            Queen
            Charlotte's
            Sound,
            and
            that
            the
            forts
            on
            Long
            Island
            were
            the
            remains
            of
            this
            war.
            It
            seems
            that
            <i>Rauperaha</i>
            had
            crossed
            the
            strait
            a
            year
            or
            two
            previously
            in
            canoes,
            and
            had
            established,
            <i>vi
                et
                armis,</i>
            his
            claim
            to
            that
            island
            and
            <i>Motuara,</i>
            which
            the
            <i>Ngatiawa</i>
            had
            disputed
            at
            the
            cost
            of
            eight
            men.
            The
            <i>Ngahitau,</i>
            too,
            who
            had
            originally
            occupied
            Cloudy
            Bay,
            had
            frequently
            followed
            their
            chief
            <i>Tuawaiki,</i>
            or
            "Bloody
            Jack,"
            in
            expeditions
            to
            recover
            their
            settlements;
            and
            it
            was
            not
            many
            years
            since
            <i>Rauperaha</i>
            had
            succeeded
            in
            driving
            them
            away,
            and
            establishing
            some
            of
            his
            relations
            in
            Port
            Underwood
            or
            <i>Wanganui,</i>
            the
            ship-harbour
            of
            Cloudy
            Bay.
            Thus
            it
            seemed,
            plain
            that,
            even
            with
            regard
            to
            the
            ownership
            of
            their
            villages
            and
            potato-gardens,
            <i>might</i>
            constituted
            the
            only
            right.
            As
            to
            the
            parts
            lying
            waste,
            we
            collected
            that
            they
            were
            not
            thought
            of
            or
            claimed
            by
            any
            one.
            Many
            White
            men
            had
            cleared
            and
            cultivated
            patches
            of
            land
            without
            bargain
            or
            interruption.
            These
            natives
            had
            not,
            like
            those
            in
            the
            neighbourhood
            of
            the
            Bay
            of
            Islands,
            learned
            that
            White
            men
            were
            willing
            to
            pay
            a
            high
            price
            for
            desert
            land;
            and
            there
            did
            not
            seem
            to
            have
            ever
            been
            any
            written
            bargain
            for
            land
            before
            our
            arrival.
            We
            had
            become
            aware,
            from
            the
            evidence
            of
            missionaries
            given
            before
            a
            Committee
            of
            the
            House
            of
            Lords
            in
            1838,
            that
            a
            very
            different
            state
            of
            things
            prevailed
            in
            the
            northern
            part
            of
            the
            islands;
            but
            it
            was
            to
            be
            remembered
            that
            there,
            so
            early
            as
            1814,
            Mr.
            Marsden,
            the
            founder
            of
            the
            Church
            Mission,
            had
            brought
            a
            formal
            deed
            from
            Sydney,
            in
            order
            to
            complete
            an
            agreement
            for
            the
            land
            on
            which
            the
            Mission
            buildings
            were
            to
            stand;
            and
            that,
            since
            that
            time,
            numerous
            similar
            purchases
            on
            a
            large
            scale
            had
            been
            made
            by
            the
            missionaries
            as
            well
            as
            by
            lay
            settlers,
            who
            created
            a
            considerable
            demand
            for
            land
            in
            that
            portion
            of
            the
            country.
            Dicky
            told
            us
            plainly,
            that
            our
            wish
            to
            purchase
            a
            large
            district
            of
            waste
            land
            would
            be
            looked
            upon
            as
            a
            novelty
            by
            the
            natives
            here.
            From
            the
            information
            which
            we
            gathered
            from
            him
            and
            other
            persons,
            I
            feel
            convinced
            that
            a
            large
            body
            of
            settlers
            might
            have
            pitched
            their
            tents
            in
            many

        <div class="simon"><p>Jerningham is parroting his father Edward Gibbon here, as this system was of his devising. It will come as no surprise that this system did not quite work out as intended. It's hard to know to what extent this "native reserve" system 
            was a genuine (if paternalistic) attempt to help Māori, or if it was simply intended to deflect criticism from Missionary groups in Britain. Certainly, the 
            New Zealand Company had no shortage of critics.
