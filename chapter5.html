        <h2> CHAPTER V.</h2>
        <h3>Cloudy Bay.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> ON the morning of the 4th of November, we sailed from Port
            Nicholson, and anchored at night in the mouth of Port Underwood in Cloudy Bay. The lofty
            and more barren mountains beneath which it lies struck us as cheerless and desolate
            after the shores of Port Nicholson; and rude flurries of wind from the high peaks
            whistled among our rigging.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> In the morning of the 5th we warped further into the harbour; and
            found no less a contrast in the character of the natives inhabiting the two places. The
            <i>Kawia</i> natives had evidently been incited against us by Guard and Wynen, who had
            been inclined before our arrival to purchase Port Nicholson themselves, but had
            abandoned this idea in the hope of either deriving some benefit from our purchase of the
            <i>Ohiere</i> or of forestalling us by buying it themselves. The fact that we had
            employed, a <i>Te-awa-iti</i> agent in negotiating with the rival <i>Ngatiawa</i> tribe,
            had also excited their envy and jealousy. "Gun-eye" and Charley, with their elder
            brother <i>Puaha,</i> and their uncle <i>Ngaharua,</i> a near relation of
            <i>Rauperaha,</i> who was more commonly called "Tommy Street," after a merchant whom he
            had visited in Sydney; a tall bullying chief named "the Big Fellow," and several others,
            came on board and complained that we had purchased <i>Poneke,</i> as they called Port
            Nicholson, while it belonged to <i>Rauperaha</i> and the rest of the <i>Kawia</i> tribe.
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Colonel Wakefield answered, that he had bought it from the natives
            in possession of it, who asserted it to be theirs; and that the <i>Kawia</i> had better
            ask <i>Warepori</i> for some of the payment, if they had a real and solid claim. He
            advised them, jokingly, to make haste, lest there should be nothing left but the muskets
            and ball-cartridge. This hint, and the hospitality of our cabin-table, quickly made
            friends of these chiefs; and they very soon abandoned this subject, and took up that of
            the purchase of the <i>Ohiere.</i> We found <i>Puaha</i> far superior to his younger
            brothers in dignity of manner. He was of a milder temper, and moreover evidently more
            capable of appreciating the advantages to be derived from a civilized White society. All
            the others seemed to look no further than the immediate payment, and the increased
            market which they might obtain for pigs, potatoes, and firewood.</div>

        </div>
        <h3>Whaling-Stations.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> We found in this harbour the Honduras bark, taking in oil and bone
            from the stations; and we were very busily employed in making up our letters for
            England.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Dicky Barrett left us at this place, proceeding to
            <i>Te-awa-iti</i> in a sealing-boat with all his family and train. He agreed to return
            to us here in order to proceed to <i>Taranaki.</i></div>
        <div class="jerningham"> The harbour of Port Underwood we found much exposed to the
            southerly gales, which send a rolling swell right in. Two bays at the head of the
            harbour are more sheltered; but in no part is there any extent of flat land.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> We found several whaling-parties on the different beaches; which
            are separated from each other by such steep ridges that boats are the more common means
            of communication. In Ocean Bay, in which the swell causes a good deal of surf, we saw
            the timbers of some small vessels which were being built there, and found an old trader
            named Ferguson who had the reputation of never being sober. On the sides of the
            impending hills are the remains of some clearings made by the crew of a whaler under the
            direction of a Captain Blenkinsopp, who purchased this bay from the natives, and was
            also said to have bought the plains of <i>Wairau,</i> a few miles further south, from
            <i>Rauperaha</i> and <i>Rangihaeata,</i> his fighting general, for a ship gun, some
            years since.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> In <i>Kakapo</i> Bay, we found Jacky Guard and all his family,
            including his wife, a fine buxom-looking Englishwoman, and the children who were with
            her prisoners among the natives. They all looked healthy and rosy.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Still further north on the west side was another bay, also
            inhabited by White people. These two bays are much better sheltered than Ocean Bay.
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> One party, conducted by a Portuguese, were established in a cove
            just inside the eastern head, and enjoyed a good look-out over to the White Bluff from
            the high neck of land above the houses.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> We had plenty of good fishing while here. A fish like the ling,
            some of which we caught weighing 50 lbs., gave great sport, requiring half an hour's
            play to kill; and some conger-eels also furnished amusement to parties who went out in
            the cutter to the reef at the entrance of the harbour. One of these enormous creatures,
            six feet long and as thick as a man's arm, floored everybody in the boat before a cut
            across his tail deprived him of his strength.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> We had completed our letters on the 9th, and only waited for
            Barrett. On the 12th, the Honduras proceeded to <i>Te-awa-iti</i> to take in oil and
            bone there. A small schooner, the Susannah Ann, arrived from Sydney a day or two before,
            to take the oil from the station of Mr. John, the Portuguese.</div>

        <div class="collapse" id="collapse1">
            <h3>Fighting Bay--Naval Engagement.</h3>
            <div class="jerningham"> On the 13th we sailed for <i>Te-awa-iti,</i> to look for
                Barrett. Arthur was again on board of us as pilot. As we ran along the seventeen
                miles of rugged and barren coast between the two places, he showed us some
                remarkable spots. The first promontory was called Run-under Point, from a boat
                having foundered near that spot while running in tow of a whale in stormy weather. A
                small bay, which sometimes affords shelter to the whale-boats when caught outside in
                a heavy gale of wind, is called Fighting Bay. Here a great naval engagement once
                took place between the canoes of <i>Rauperaha</i> and his followers, and those of
                Bloody Jack, who was at the head of a predatory party of the <i>Ngahitau.
                    Rauperaha</i> had a narrow escape on this occasion; only saving his life by
                leaving his mat in the hands of his inveterate enemy, who had seized him, and by
                diving until he got among his own canoes. He subsequently took advantage of a fog to
                abandon the scene of combat, leaving the <i>Ngatiawa,</i> whom he had persuaded to
                join him, at the mercy of their foes. This treacherous policy was, we were told, by
                no means uncommon on his part, it being his plan to destroy one enemy by means of
                another. As we approached the mouth of the Tory Channel, the wind fell light, and we
                consequently lost the flood-tide. We had been hove-to for half-an-hour, when a fresh
                breeze from south-east sprang up, and Arthur, who knew the sailing qualities of the
                Tory, told Captain Chaffers that he might "put her at it," and we rattled in against
                a four-knot tide. We flew past the southern head, on to which you might have flung a
                biscuit, with the tide-rip fizzing and smoking on either side of us. A handy ship is
                requisite to effect this entrance. We found the Honduras making eight inches of
                water, having been swung by an eddy against a rock, and narrowly escaped total
                wreck, when coming in with a fair tide yesterday.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> We found that Barrett had been detained by the illness of his
                wife; and as she was still too ill to come on board, Colonel Wakefield determined to
                cross over the Strait and effect an agreement with <i>Rauperaha,</i> and then return
                to the north entrance of the Sound for Barrett. We took with us an interpreter named
                John Brooks, who had been engaged in Cloudy Bay as a sawyer. He was thoroughly
                acquainted with the native language and habits, having been eight years among the
                wildest <i>Waikato</i> natives.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Four of our crew asked and obtained permission to leave the
                ship here, intending to settle in Cloudy Bay. Two others ran away to join them soon
                after. As the whaling season was nearly over, they would probably soon repent their
                bargain, and be glad to engage in another ship. They were the most idle of our crew;
                and were no doubt tempted by the scenes of drunkenness and low debauchery going on
                in the bays. </div>
            <div class="jerningham"> On the 16th, we stood over to <i>Kapiti,</i> leaving the
                Channel with the ebb tide. About four miles N. E. of the Brothers, we saw a
                dangerous rock, looking like a boat at a short distance. As we neared the north
                shore, we could distinguish the opening nearly abreast of the flat table island of
                <i>Mana,</i> where a small harbour called <i>Porirua</i> indents the wooded hills.
                These incline inwards from the coast a little to the south of <i>Kapiti,</i> and a
                sandy beach succeeds the rock-bound shore which extends from Cape <i>Terawiti.</i>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Battle Of Waikanae.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> As we approached <i>Kapiti,</i> which has a high peak in its
            centre, and is covered with forest to the water's edge, we made out some small islands
            lying off its south-eastern extremity. These form a very excellent anchorage for a
            limited number of ships. A whale-boat from the easternmost island soon boarded us; and
            the "headsman," or commander of the boat, piloted us into an outer roadstead in
            twenty-two fathoms, which is reckoned more convenient for a large ship than the inner
            one, as a vessel can more easily get under way in case of accident. He told us that a
            sanguinary battle had taken place at a village called <i>Waikanae</i> on the mainland,
            about three miles from our anchorage, the same morning. Many of the whalers had
            witnessed the contest from their boats outside the surf. We afterwards gathered the full
            particulars. The feast to which <i>Te Wetu</i> had told us he was going, had taken place
            on <i>Mana,</i> where the funeral obsequies of <i>Waitohi,</i> a sister of
            <i>Rauperaha,</i> had been celebrated by some thousand natives of different tribes. On
            this occasion, <i>Rauperaha</i> had killed and cooked one of the unfortunate
            <i>Rangitane</i> slaves, who brought him tribute from the Pelorus; and had shared the
            flesh among his most distinguished guests. Among these were the <i>Ngatiraukawa,</i> a
            tribe who were induced several years before by <i>Rauperaha</i> to come from the
            interior of the North Island in order to assist him in his conquest of these parts, and
            who were led by a renowned chief named <i>Watanui,</i> or "the Great Store." They
            commonly reside at <i>Otaki,</i> about twelve miles north of <i>Waikanae,</i> and had
            been incited by <i>Rauperaha</i> to annoy the <i>Ngatiawa</i> on their first arrival
            from <i>Taranaki.</i> Feuds, bloody wars, and a bitter hatred of each other, had been
            the consequence; and some of their old grievances had been revived by their meeting at
            <i>Mana. Rauperaha</i> cunningly fanned the flame; and mutual insults and recriminations
            followed, on the passage of the <i>Ngatiraukawa</i> past <i>Waikanae</i> to their homes
            after the feast. Shots were fired in defiance over their heads as they passed along the
            beach, and even some pigs which they were driving were taken from them and killed by the
            <i>Ngatiawa.</i> They prepared for a contest, were marshalled by their chiefs the same
            evening, and, by previous concert with <i>Rauperaha,</i> attacked the <i>Waikanae pa</i>
            at daylight</div>
        <div class="simon">
            <p>What Jerningham is describing here is The Battle of Kūititanga, often considered the
                last battle of the "musket wars", the period of inter-tribal warfare that followed
                the widespread adoption of muskets in New Zealand. For a number of years there has
                been an uneasy peace between former allies Te Āti Awa and Ngāti Raukawa, but now
                that peace has come to an end. Driven by a desire for revenge of past insults, and
                competing demands for land after their shared migration south, the two tribes have
                finally come to battle.</p>
            <p>Contrary to Jerningham's claims, most historians agree that Te Rauparaha had
                attempted to keep the peace between these two Ngāti Toa allies. The strength of his
                position relies on his ability to command a grand alliance of the migrants from the
                north. Their conflict puts him in an impossible position, with friends and relations
                on both sides.</p>

            <p>The image is a photolithograph of Kenakena pa from around 1845. It was this pa that
                was besieged by Ngāti Raukawa during the battle. The pa sits on the mouth of the
                Waikanae river, with Kapiti island visible in the background.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Two rivers meet there, the <i>Waimea</i> and the <i>Waikanae.</i> A
            small out-lying village, situated on the sandy tongue of land between the two, sustained
            the first brunt of the attack. A <i>Ngatiraukawa</i> spy, who found a boy of ten years
            old awake in one of the huts, asked him for a light for his pipe, thinking to make him
            believe that he was a friend. His blood, however, was the first spilt; for the gallant
            little fellow took up a loaded musket and shot him dead on the spot. His friends now
            invested the village, which, with only about thirty men, held out until their friends
            from the main <i>pa</i> were roused by the firing and crossed the <i>Waikanae</i> to
            their assistance. A fierce and bloody contest ensued, ending in the retreat of the
            invaders, and their total rout along the sandy beach.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>Rauperaha,</i> who had failed to bring the assistance of men and
            ammunition which he had promised to <i>Watanui,</i> landed from his canoe late in the
            skirmish, but swam through the surf to it on the first symptoms of defeat, the
            <i>Ngatiraukawa</i> losing many men in a vigorous rally made to cover his escape.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> The numbers engaged had been, from all that we could gather, about
            equal on both sides, to the amount of 400 or 500 men each; but the defeated had left
            fifty dead on the field, and the conquerors only eighteen. The beaten party had managed
            to carry off their wounded, of whom there were a much larger number on both sides.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> We had just made up a boat's crew from the cabin party, to go over
            and see the field of battle, the surgeons taking their instruments with them, when a
            message arrived from <i>Rauperaha.</i> He was on Evans's Island, the nearest to the ship
            of the three islets, and expressed a desire to see Colonel Wakefield. We therefore
            pulled round and went to see him.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> He had just returned from the scene of bloodshed, whither he
            asserted that he had gone to restore peace; and, seeing the arrival of our ship, which
            was taken for a man-of-war by many even of the Europeans, he had betaken himself with
            all his goods to the residence of an English whaler named Thomas Evans, on whom he
            relied for protection from some imaginary danger.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> We had heard, while in Cloudy Bay, that <i>Rauperaha</i> had
            expressed himself in somewhat violent terms towards us for purchasing Port Nicholson
            without his sanction; and he was described by the whalers as giving way to great alarm
            when told what the ship was, and as having inquired anxiously what natives we had on
            board. </div>
        <h3>Rauperaha--His Appearance.</h3>
        <div class="simon">
            <p>At last we meet Te Rauparaha, one of the greatest figures of the period. He is the
                architect of Ngāti Toa's great migration south, and has spent the last two decades
                negotiating a delicate web of alliances and rivalries, always with the aim of
                securing his tribe's position in the roiling chaos of post-musket New Zealand. A
                thorough account of Te Rauparaha's history and the history of Ngāti Toa could (and
                does) fill several history books, so I won't get too deep into it here. As
                Jerningham meets him, Te Rauparaha has established a stronghold on Kapiti island
                that ensures his relative safety, aloof from the battles between his erstwhile
                allies. Whaling stations around Kapiti and Mana islands, some run by Māori and
                others by Europeans, ensure a steady trade in muskets and other goods. But the
                crumbling of the Ngāti Raukawa and Te Āti Awa alliance leaves him in a precarious
                position, forced to choose sides. In the south, Ngai Tahu are an increasingly
                troublesome thorn in his side. The arrival of the Tory could prove to be either a
                great boon, or a destabilising force.</p>
            <p>The other thing you need to know is that Jerningham _hates_ Te Rauparaha. He receives
                the worst of Jerningham's slights, and the pettiest of his insults. Jerningham never
                misses an opportunity to get a dig in at him, starting with this section about his
                looks. As unfair as this characterisation is, we'll see later that Jerningham has
                his reasons for disliking Te Rauparaha.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> As we leaped from our boat he advanced to meet us, and, with looks
            of evident fear and distrust, eagerly sought our hands to exchange the missionary
            greeting. During the whole of the ensuing conversation he seemed uneasy and insecure in
            his own opinion; and the whalers present described this behaviour as totally at variance
            with his usual boastfulness and arrogance. He made us a pious speech about the battle,
            saying that he had had no part in it, and that he was determined to give no
            encouragement to fighting. He agreed to come on board the next day; and departed to one
            of the neighbouring islands.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> He is rather under the average height, and very dignified and
            stately in his manner, although on this occasion it was much affected by the wandering
            and watchful glances which he frequently threw around him, as though distrustful of
            every one.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Although at least sixty years old, he might have passed for a much
            younger man, being hale and stout, and his hair but slightly grizzled.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> His features are aquiline and striking; but an overhanging upper
            lip, and a retreating forehead, on which his eyebrows wrinkled back when he lifted his
            deep-sunken eyelids and penetrating eyes, produced a fatal effect on the good
            <i>prestige</i> arising from his first appearance. The great chieftain, the man able to
            lead others, and habituated to wield authority, was clear at first sight; but the savage
            ferocity of the tiger, who would not scruple to use any means for the attainment of that
            power, the destructive ambition of a selfish despot, was plainly discernible on a nearer
            view.</div>

            <p>This sketch of Te Rauparaha by William Bambridge is from later in his life, around
                1847, but I think it gives more of a sense of personality than more contemporary

            <h3>Rauperaha-His History.</h3>
            <div class="jerningham"> Previous to 1825 he had lived among his tribe, the
                <i>Ngatitoa,</i> in the neighbourhood of <i>Kawia. Hongi</i> <a href="#note1"
                    id="note_ref1">
                    <div class="superscript">1</div>
                </a> returned from his visit to England in 1820, provided with muskets and devoured
                with restless ambition. His followers became, by their possession of fire-arms, the
                most powerful tribe in New Zealand. At their head he ravaged the whole northern end
                of the North Island. In consequence of these devastating wars the <i>Waikato</i> and
                <i>Kawia</i> tribes pressed upon each other, and the latter were obliged to give way
                in the struggle.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> <i>Rauperaha</i> had already gained a great name by his warlike
                achievements; and he was thought worthy of a place second only to the head chief
                <i>Te Pehi</i> in the guidance of the expelled tribe, which came southward to seize
                upon a new home.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> <i>Te Pehi Kupe</i> was the same man who afterwards visited
                England. He was known in former publications by the name of <i>Tupai Cupa,</i> a
                corruption of his real title. <a href="#note2" id="note_ref2">
                    <div class="superscript">2</div>
                </a> He married a wife of rank from the <i>Ngatiawa</i> tribe; and <i>Rauperaha</i>
                himself was descended from a <i>Ngatiawa</i> mother. The two tribes were
                consequently allied to a considerable degree; and it was not until the <i>Kawia</i>
                reached the southern boundary of the <i>Taranaki</i> district, in which the
                <i>Ngatiawa</i> dwelt, that their migration was arrested by opposition. Beyond the
                habitations of the <i>Ngatiawa</i> they met a population composed of various
                barbarous tribes, for the most part the aboriginal occupants of those regions.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> The <i>Ngatiruanui</i> and <i>Ngarauru</i> occupied the coast
                between Cape Egmont and <i>Wanganui.</i> At the latter place there was a mixed
                population, formed of the original occupants, the <i>Ngatiruaka</i> and
                <i>Ngatipa,</i> and the migrators from a large and powerful tribe who had dwelt on
                the banks of a lake called <i>Taupo,</i> far in the interior. These immigrants, who
                consisted of the <i>Ngatitahi</i> and <i>Patutokoto</i> tribes, had first compelled
                a cession of territory from the aborigines, and finally amalgamated with them in a
                friendly way; both uniting under the generic name of the <i>Wanganui</i> tribes. The
                <i>Ngatiapa, Rangitane,</i> and <i>Muopoko</i> occupied the succeeding coast as far
                as <i>Kapiti,</i> and also shared the southern shores of Cook's Strait with the
                <i>Ngahitau</i> who inhabited Cloudy Bay and Queen Charlotte's Sound. A branch of
                the numerous <i>Ngatikahuhunu</i> tribes occupied the neighbourhood of
                <i>Wanganui-a-te-ra,</i> or "Large Bay towards the Sun," as Port Nicholson was
                called, in contra-distinction to <i>Wanganui</i> (Port Underwood) in Cloudy Bay. <a
                    href="#note3" id="note_ref3">
                    <div class="superscript">3</div>
                </a></div>
            <div class="jerningham"> The invading party consisted of the <i>Ngatitoa, Ngatitama,</i>
                and <i>Ngatimutunga</i> tribes, led by their respective head men; and was directed
                in chief by <i>Rauperaha</i> and <i>Te Pehi. Rangihaeata,</i> or "Sky jealous of the
                Dawn," was another leading chief of the <i>Ngatitoa,</i> and had acquired another
                name, <i>Mokau,</i> from some exploit or defeat at a river of that name south of
                <i>Kawia. E Mare</i> was at the head of the <i>Ngatimutunga;</i> and our friend
                "Dog's-ear" and some others led the <i>Ngatitama.</i></div>
            <div class="jerningham"> It is related that the invaders possessed but few fire-arms;
                and the success with which they overcame the resistance of their opponents, who far
                exceeded them in number, seems to have been owing rather to their having become well
                inured to war during their struggles with the <i>Waikato</i> and other northern
                tribes, and to the consequent elevation among them of a few experienced and
                determined chieftains, than to any vast superiority in weapons of war.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Between the rivers <i>Patea</i> and <i>Wenuakura,</i> in a
                commanding position in the centre of the <i>Ngatiruanui</i> country, seems to have
                been the spot where the first pause was made by the invaders, as though to take
                breath. A detached cliff, 200 feet in height, inaccessible on all sides except by a
                narrow and ascending neck of land, formed a secure position in native warfare, which
                boasted of no projectile weapons. The old men of the <i>Ngatiruanui,</i> who still
                inhabit a <i>pa</i> on its summit called <i>Tihoe,</i> describe it as having been
                tenanted by <i>Rauperaha</i> and his followers for a considerable space of time. The
                aboriginal tribes seem to have sought shelter in the interior from the invading
                body, as they and their descendants at this time inhabit the same part of the coast
                in large numbers. </div>
            <div class="jerningham"> The next conflict took place on the banks of the
                <i>Wanganui</i> river. Deep and wide, it must have afforded a great aid in
                obstructing the progress of the conquerors. The remains are still in existence, on
                the south bank of the river near its mouth, of the extensive earthen fortifications
                erected by the <i>Wanganui</i> tribes, and taken by <i>Rauperaha</i> and <i>Te
                    Pehi;</i> when they destroyed such numbers of their enemies, that every family
                there at the present day bears the hope and desire of revenge. The <i>Ngatiapa</i>
                and <i>Rangitane,</i> who dwelt in the country watered by the <i>Wangaihu,
                    Turakina,</i> and <i>Rangitiki</i> rivers, were next slaughtered or put to
                flight; and the <i>Muopoko</i> were compelled to yield before the victorious party
                as it swept the country between <i>Manawatu</i> and the island of <i>Kapiti,</i>
                opposite to which a halt was again called.</div>
            <h3>Siege And Capture Of Kapiti.</h3>
            <div class="jerningham"> This island, lying four miles from the shore, and abounding in
                natural fastnesses, became the stronghold of the defeated party. The multitudes who
                had yielded to the first shock began to gather in the rear of the <i>Kawia;</i> and
                while they were closed in from retreat by a muster on the <i>Rangitiki,</i> the
                country to the south was still occupied by the original inhabitants, who prepared to
                defend their native land. The position of the small but vigorous party became
                imminently hazardous. </div>
            <div class="jerningham"> <i>Rauperaha</i> now sought and obtained assistance from the
                <i>Ngatiraukawa</i> or "Boiling-water" tribes, who at that time inhabited the
                north-eastern shores of Lake <i>Taupo.</i> About sixty chosen warriors, under a
                chief named <i>E Ahu Karamu,</i> forced their way through the hardships of the
                inland path, and the dangers and ambushes of the opposing tribes, and joined him
                near <i>Kapiti.</i>
            </div>
            <div class="jerningham"> It was about this time that a jealousy as to fame and influence
                arose between <i>Te Pehi</i> and <i>Rauperaha.</i> An anecdote was related to me by
                a near relation of <i>Te Pehi,</i> which is a full illustration of
                <i>Rauperaha's</i> treacherous disposition, even towards his allies.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> It was after the repulse of several united attempts to conquer
                <i>Kapiti,</i> that one night he left <i>Te Pehi</i> asleep at the common
                encampment; and, taking with him all but a small party of <i>Pehi's</i> immediate
                followers and relations, started for <i>Rangitiki;</i> intending to obtain the glory
                of a victory for himself, while he left his rival exposed, with a weak retinue, to
                any sortie which the refugees on <i>Kapiti</i> might attempt. <i>Pehi,</i> on
                waking, remarked the diminished numbers of the warriors, and asked why the huts were
                empty and <i>Rauperaha</i> absent. "He is by this time near <i>Rangitiki,</i>"
                answered one of his followers. "Then I shall be master of <i>Kapiti</i> or dead,"
                replied <i>Pehi, "</i>by the time he returns." He mustered his men in the canoes,
                and gallantly effected, with the few devoted followers who had refused to desert
                him, the conquest which had been impossible to the whole body when divided by
                <i>Rauperaha's,</i> envious intrigues.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> <i>E Ahu Karamu</i> returned to <i>Taupo,</i> and related to
                the rest of his tribe how fine an opening had been made for them on the sea-coast,
                dwelling on the advantages to be derived from fishing and trading with the White
                men. He bore <i>Rauperaha's,</i> invitation to the other chiefs to lead their men to
                Cook's Strait, where he would assign them a part of his conquest to enjoy and
                maintain, while they assisted him in crushing the remains of the insurgents about
                <i>Rangitiki</i> and <i>Manawatu.</i> The conflicting opinions as to the expediency
                of this course were peremptorily terminated by <i>E Ahu,</i> who ordered his young
                men to burn the houses at <i>Taupo;</i> and the <i>Ngatiraukawa</i> migrated in
                successive bodies to the coast. <i>Rauperaha</i> then proceeded with their
                assistance to crush the remains of the aboriginal tribes; and only spared the lives
                of the few <i>Muopoko</i> now existing in that neighbourhood at the urgent entreaty
                of <i>Watanui,</i> a great chief of the <i>Ngatiraukawa,</i> to leave them as slaves
                for him.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> <i>Manawatu, Ohau,</i> and <i>Otaki,</i> and the shores of the
                <i>Horowenua</i> and several adjacent lakes, were occupied by these recent allies.
            </div>
            <div class="jerningham"> In the mean while, <i>Rauperaha</i> had crossed the Strait, and
                carried destruction among the peaceful inhabitants of the Pelorus and other parts of
                the opposite coast, as I have previously related.</div>
            <h3>Visit Of Te Pehi To England.</h3>
            <div class="jerningham"> Early in 1826, <i>Te Pehi</i> went on board an English ship
                which was going through the Strait; and obtained, by his perseverance and energy,
                the object which he had most at heart, --namely, a passage to England, in order to
                bring back, like his old conqueror <i>Hongi,</i> a stock of fire-arms from that
                country. He left his son <i>Te Hiko o te rangi,</i> or "the Lightning of Heaven," to
                take his station among the tribe. The details of <i>Pehi's</i> sojourn in England
                are related at full length in another work. <a href="#note4" id="note_ref4">
                    <div class="superscript">4</div>
                </a></div>
            <div class="jerningham"> During <i>Pehi's</i> absence <i>Rauperaha's</i> influence was
                greatly increased by his talents for intrigue; <i>Hiko</i> being but a young man,
                and of too little experience and authority to lead warriors or to wield the affairs
                of numerous allied tribes. </div>
            <div class="jerningham"> <i>Pehi</i> returned from England without having obtained a
                large present of fire-arms; but with a strong disposition to adopt civilized customs
                and to encourage the friendship and society of the White man. Had he lived to this
                day, he would probably have been a powerful instrument in the task of improving his
                numerous followers. </div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Soon after his return he proceeded to Banks's Peninsula in the
                Middle Island, in order to procure some greenstone or <i>ponamu</i> from the
                <i>Ngahitau</i> living there, with whom a truce was then existing. He was
                treacherously attacked, killed, and eaten, by those among whom he had trusted
                himself with the most implicit confidence.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> It was to revenge his death that <i>Rauperaha</i> undertook, in
                1830, the expedition which has attracted so much attention, because an Englishman
                lent his aid in all ways to the bloody and revolting scenes by which it was
                distinguished. </div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Stewart, the captain of the brig Elizabeth, trading from Sydney
                to New Zealand, and another White savage who acted as supercargo of the vessel,
                agreed to take <i>Rauperaha</i> with <i>Hiko</i> and a body of their followers down
                to the place, and to remain at his disposal until he had accomplished his object, on
                condition that the brig should be loaded with flax on her return to <i>Kapiti.</i>
            </div>
            <div class="jerningham"> The White men landed first and enticed the head chief, <i>Te
                    Mairanui,</i> on board the ship where his foes lay concealed. The latter then
                went ashore, accompanied by the supercargo, and massacred or made captives nearly
                the whole unsuspecting population, to the amount of two or three thousand persons.
                The supercargo boasted, on his return to the ship, of the number whom he had shot
                with his own gun, as though he had been at a <i>battue</i> of game. Two White
                adventurers who had been befriended by the chief on shore, came off and cried over
                their protector. They narrowly escaped death themselves, the captain having advised
                the natives to get rid of persons who might report the affair at Sydney, and bring
                down punishment on all concerned. The natives, however, unlike the captain, refused
                to injure those with whom they had no quarrel; and the White men were landed when
                the ship returned to <i>Kapiti.</i> The ship's coppers are related to have prepared
                the inhuman feast of the cannibals as well as the food of the other savages; and the
                chief, after being exhibited as a captive at <i>Kapiti</i> and <i>Otaki,</i> was
                killed with the usual tortures, and his body dispersed among the relations of <i>Te
                    Pehi.</i></div>
            <div class="jerningham"> <i>Mairanui</i> had been kept for four or five weeks on board
                the ship by Stewart, as a hostage for the payment of the flax: but when it was plain
                that no flax was forthcoming, notwithstanding the promises and excuses of the
                natives, Stewart gave him up into their hands, and sailed away to Sydney unpaid for
                his infamous services.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Shameful to relate, although a deputation from the southern
                tribe, backed by the representations of the Rev. Mr. Marsden, the venerable founder
                of the Church mission in New Zealand, waited upon the Government of New South Wales,
                in order to obtain for Captain Stewart the penalty which he deserved, he escaped
                with impunity. The affair was hushed up; evidence which might have been obtained was
                put out of the way, and he was tried and acquitted. <a href="#note5" id="note_ref5">

            <h3>Rauperaha's Influence And Treachery.</h3>
            <div class="jerningham"> Since <i>Te Pehi's</i> death, <i>Rauperaha</i> had become the
                sole <i>Ariki</i> or ruler of Cook's Strait; easily weighing down the balance of
                <i>Hiko's</i> higher descent by his own superior talents of deceit and knowledge of
                their little world. </div>
            <div class="jerningham"> When the <i>Ngatiawa</i> migrated from <i>Taranaki</i> in about
                1834 or 1835, he foresaw a probable obstacle to his authority, and moved every
                indirect means to arrest their progress and to destroy them as they came. He induced
                some of his old allies at <i>Taupo</i> to join with the <i>Wanganui</i> tribes in a
                powerful opposition to their advance; and when this manoeuvre was defeated by
                <i>Hiko,</i> who led a large party to the rescue of his mother's relations,
                <i>Rauperaha</i> hounded the <i>Ngatiraukawa</i> on to their track.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Since their successful establishment, he had vainly endeavoured
                to injure them by treacherous alliance or open enmity, and had acquired among them a
                reputation for duplicity and cruelty almost unexampled in the traditions of even
                <i>Maori</i> history. </div>
            <div class="jerningham"> Innumerable accounts have been related to me of
                <i>Rauperaha's</i> unbounded treachery. No sacrifice of honour or feeling seems to
                have been too great for him, if conducive to his own aggrandizement or security. He
                has been known to throw one of his own men overboard in order to lighten his canoe
                when pursued by the enemy; and he had slaughtered one of his own slaves at the late
                feast at <i>Mana,</i> to appear opulent in the eyes of his assembled guests. This
                was one of the poor, submissive, hard-working tributaries whom we had seen at the
                Pelorus.</div>
            <div class="jerningham"> In his intercourse with the White whalers and traders and the
                shipping in the Strait, he had universally distinguished himself by the same
                qualities. </div>
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> By dint of cringing and fawning upon those who showed power and
            inclination to resist his constant extortions, and the most determined insolence and
            bullying towards those whom he knew to be at his mercy, he succeeded in obtaining a
            large revenue from the White population whether transient or permanent, which he
            invariably applied to the extension of his power among the natives.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> He was always accompanied in these marauding excursions, which he
            frequently extended over to Cloudy Bay and Queen Charlotte's Sound, by
            <i>Rangihaeata,</i> who had become his inseparable companion since his rise in
            authority. Their respective stations were pithily described by one of the whalers, who
            told us that "the <i>Robuller,"</i> as he mispronounced his name, "cast the bullets, and
            the <i>Rangihaeata</i> shot them." <i>Rauperaha</i> was the mind and his mate the body
            on these black-mail-gathering rounds. They had both acquired a violent taste for grog;
            and this, with fire-arms and powder, were the principal articles demanded.</div>
        <h3>Whaling-Stations-- Waikanae.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> The whaling-station on Evans's Island we found to be more complete,
            and under more thorough discipline and efficient management, than those in Port
            Underwood or at <i>Te-awa-iti.</i> The boats put off after a whale just as we arrived,
            and struck us by their precision and good appointment. The head of the party was a
            determined-looking man of middle age, named Tommy Evans. He was obliging and hospitable
            in the extreme to us during our stay; and was reckoned the best master at <i>Kapiti.</i>
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> On one of the other small islands was a station conducted by an
            American, who is a renowned enemy of the whale; and two other stations were situated on
            the northern part of the great island of <i>Kapiti.</i> All these stations seemed to us
            to bear a more favourable aspect than those on the other side of the Strait. But little
            of the same brutal jealousy existed between the different parties, although there was
            plenty of emulation. The whalers were much more united among themselves and independent
            of the natives; and, although frequent drunkenness and fighting went on ashore, the duty
            seemed to be done with more alacrity, and the native women appeared to exercise less
            influence in fomenting quarrels between their White companions. There were fewer
            nondescript traders and idlers here than at the other places; and the "headsmen" or
            leaders had less trouble in keeping their parties together and maintaining the strict
            discipline necessary to ensure good work.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Evans's party had taken 250 tons of oil, and he told us that his
            own profits alone would amount to 300<i>l</i>.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> On the 17th I accompanied our three surgeons to <i>Waikanae,</i> to
            carry succour to the wounded. We also took over <i>E Patu,</i> a young chief of Queen
            Charlotte's Sound, who had begged a passage from <i>Te-awa-iti,</i> and found that he
            had lost his uncle in the battle. We landed on the sandy beach, in front of a small
            village called <i>Te Uruhi,</i> where the <i>tangi</i> was going on over the corpse.
            Having left him among his mourning relations, we proceeded to the main <i>pa,</i> at the
            mouth of the <i>Waikanae</i> river, about a mile further north. We were loudly greeted,
            and conducted into a large court of the village, where five hundred men, women, and
            children were assembled in a row to shake hands with us. This was no small task; but in
            order to show them that we approved of their newly-acquired missionary principles, we
            carefully went through the whole ceremony.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> This was the largest <i>pa</i> we had yet seen. The outer stockades
            were at least a mile in circumference; and the various passages between the different
            courts and divisions formed a perfect labyrinth. A numerous train of youths guided us to
            the houses of the wounded men. As we passed, we observed one of the dead chiefs laid out
            in state in the court before his <i>ware puni.</i> His body was wrapt in his best mats;
            and his head, with the hair neatly arranged and copiously ornamented with feathers,
            reclined against a carved post, which was painted with <i>kokowai,</i> or red ochre. In
            circles around stood or sat his friends and relations, wailing and lacerating their
            faces and limbs.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Our surgeons were all three hard at work for some hours, extracting
            bullets, binding up wounds, and setting broken limbs. We found the wounds bound up by
            the natives generally with the leaf of the flax, and bark splints on the broken limbs.
            The patients bore pain with the most perfect stoicism.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> The inhabitants of this village professed to be all Christians,
            having been converted by native teachers. Accordingly, they buried their fallen enemies
            on the field of battle; adhering, however, in some degree to the native superstitions,
            by burying a stock of tobacco and pipes with each, to console him on his way to the
            <i>Reinga,</i> or future life according to their belief.</div>
        <h3>Rauperaha On Board.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> On our return to the ship we found that <i>Rauperaha</i> had been
            on board, having been received by Colonel Wakefield with a salute to the New Zealand
            flag, which he did not at all understand. Indeed, it rather alarmed him, until it was
            explained that an honour was intended to him and the chiefs who accompanied him.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Mr. Wynen had preceded us from Cloudy Bay; and the chiefs were at
            first much opposed to selling any land, saying that they had been told the White people
            would drive them away from their future settlements. They were also exceedingly jealous
            of our purchase of Port Nicholson.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Colonel Wakefield, after much discussion, appeared to convince them
            of the friendly intentions of the White people towards them, and that they would be much
            benefited by their arrival; and they finished by saying, "Look at the land! if it is
            good, take it!"</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>Rauperaha</i> staid on board to dinner, with his wife, a tall
            Meg-Merrilies-like woman, who had a bushy head of hair, frizzled out to the height of
            six inches all round, and a masculine voice and appetite. She is the daughter of his
            last wife by a former husband.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>Rauperaha</i> and several other of the <i>Kawia</i> chiefs drank
            ardent spirits freely, repudiating the use of water, and refusing with great contempt
            anything less than a full tumbler. It did not seem, however, to have the same effect
            upon them that it would have upon a person unhardened to the use of liquor.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>Rauperaha</i> sat for his portrait to Mr. Heaphy, and made a
            noisy demand for a waistcoat in payment as soon as the sitting was over. Indeed, he
            asked shamelessly for everything which he saw, and he seemed well used to being refused.
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> On the 18th, the chiefs were again on board.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>Tungia,</i> who was the father of Tommy Evans's native wife, and
            nicknamed "the Wild Fellow" by the whalers, was remarkable for his noisy and turbulent
            manner. All the others, except <i>Hiko</i> and his uncle <i>Rangihiroa,</i> had the same
            bad qualities which we had observed in the Cloudy Bay natives. They united the
            uncontrolled ferocity of the savage to the acquired indifference to honour and the
            degrading vices of the White outcasts among whom they had dwelt.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>Hiko</i> struck us forcibly by his commanding stature, by his
            noble intelligent physiognomy, and by his truly chieftain-like demeanour. His descent by
            both parents pointed him out as a great leader in Cook's Strait, should he inherit his
            father's great qualities. He was sparing of his words, and mild of speech. He had
            carefully treasured up his father's instructions, and the relics of his voyage to
            England. He showed us a volume of the Library of Entertaining Knowledge on the New
            Zealanders, in which is contained a portrait of <i>Te Pehi,</i> on which he placed great
            store. He was said to pay his slaves for their work, and to treat them with unusual
            kindness, and the White men spoke of him as mild and inoffensive in his intercourse with
            them.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>Rangihiroa,</i> the younger brother of <i>Pehi,</i> was also a
            worthy old chieftain. He was free from the vices of the other <i>Kawia</i> chiefs, and
            was universally well spoken of as kind-hearted to all his fellow-creatures of both races
            by even the most depraved of the White men. He seemed shy of putting himself forward in
            the discussion, but approved of the proposed transaction in a mild and firm speech, made
            for himself and for his nephew, who had not yet ventured to rely on his eloquence in the
            conclave of chiefs.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> A gale from south-east detained the natives on shore</div>
        <h3>Hiko--Negotiations.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> until the 21st, when they came off, and the proposition was again
            made to them of purchasing the whole of their rights and claims of whatever sort to land
            on both sides of the Strait.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> They again discussed the matter very fully, and asked to look at
            the goods. This was complied with; and though they evidently considered the quantity as
            far beyond anything they had yet seen or heard of in payment for a thing so great a drug
            as land, they could not refrain from haggling and bargaining for an addition to the
            heap. <i>Hiko</i> requested more soap, women's clothing, slates, and such useful
            articles; while <i>Rau- peraha</i> and his party pressed for more fire-arms and powder.
            This was arranged, after some trouble and disagreement; and Colonel Wakefield proceeded
            to explain to them, by means of the interpreter, the whole force of the bargain into
            which he wished to enter with them. A plan of those parts of the two islands over which
            their conquests extended was carefully examined by them; and it was fully explained to
            them that, after this transaction, they would have no more land, or rights over land of
            any sort to sell, and that they could not receive any further payment whatever hereafter
            for any land if they joined in this agreement. They were also told that a suitable
            portion for the maintenance of the chiefs, with their families and successors, would be
            made <i>tapu</i> for them for ever; and that those natives who worked for the White
            people would be paid by them for their labour. All this was repeated to them over and
            over again in different forms, till they showed themselves perfectly acquainted with the
            bargain which they were to accept or refuse. They ended by agreeing fully to every
            provision; and <i>Rauperaha</i> dictated to me the native names of all the places on
            both coasts to which they had any claim, whether by conquest or inheritance. This
            operation took some time, as I made him repeat some of the names several times, in order
            to write them down clearly, and as he showed me the position of each on the map before
            mentioned. He then joined with the others in consenting to cede the whole of his rights
            whatsoever to land in those places. They all agreed to come on board to sign the deed,
            and receive the payment, the next day.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>Hiko,</i> however, fell ill, and bad weather prevented the
            others from leaving the shore. <i>Rauperaha,</i> who is not to be deterred by anything
            from his own selfish objects, came off through a rough sea, in a substantial,
            strong-built, well-manned canoe, and tried to induce Colonel Wakefield to conclude the
            transaction without <i>Hiko.</i> "He is only a boy," said he, "and has nothing to do
            with the land. Give me the goods, with more powder and arms. Of what use are blankets,
            soap, tools, and iron pots, when we are going to war? What does it matter whether we die
            cold or warm, clean or dirty, hungry or full? Give us two-barrelled guns, plenty of
            muskets, lead, powder, cartridges, and cartouch-boxes." His proposition was of course
            quietly refused.</div>
        <h3>Quarrel Among Chiefs.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> A small brig, the Syren, arrived here from Sydney to-day in the
            thick of the gale from N. W. Having tried to beat up after passing the island, she was
            baffled by the adverse wind and tide; and Tommy Evans, who was prevented by their bad
            management in going about from succeeding in a gallant effort to get on board, had a
            desperate pull back, which lasted two or three hours, against tide and wind. We went on
            board her when she anchored, on the gale abating in the evening, and found her in a
            wretched state, She had no binnacle, and only a boat-compass; no second suit of sails, a
            boat not sea-worthy, a broken windlass, no chronometer, and she was already so short of
            food that the passengers were living on the peas out of the grummets used to keep the
            plates on the table. The captain told us that great excitement had been caused in Sydney
            by the news of our expedition and its objects; and that many parties were preparing to
            come down to this part of New Zealand for the purpose of buying up tracts of land in the
            neighbourhood of the intended settlements. Even in this ship were numerous deeds sent
            down to agents here in order to confirm some purchases agreed upon at former times, and
            for which some small pre-payment had been made.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> 23rd. --The Tory having shifted her berth nearer to the two small
            islands on which the natives principally reside, the chiefs again came off, <i>Hiko</i>
            and his uncle in a nice whale-boat belonging to the former. A third <i>korero</i> took
            place before about twenty White witnesses and a numerous attendance of natives from the
            shore, so that the deck was quite crowded. All expressed their perfect consent to the
            sale, and asked for the payment to be made. The goods were accordingly got up and placed
            on deck. Colonel Wakefield had added a bale of clothing, and several other useful
            articles, at the request of <i>Hiko,</i> who had persuaded the others to cease their
            clamours for fire-arms. A dozen fowling-pieces, included in the payment, were brought up
            and placed, ready for distribution, on the companion-hatch.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>Rauperaha, Tungia,</i> and the other warlike chiefs, rushed at
            these in the wildest manner, each attempting to seize one; but they were all immediately
            removed out of their reach; and <i>Hiko,</i> who had been trying on one of the coats
            preparatory to the distribution, no sooner saw the selfishness and ill-faith of his
            rivals, than he took off the coat, called to <i>Rangihiroa,</i> who had</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> remained an unmoved spectator of the whole scene, and steered his
            boat to the shore in high dudgeon.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Colonel Wakefield immediately declared the negotiation at an end,
            and ordered the goods below. The turbulent chiefs loudly vented their disappointment at
            this aspect of the affair, laid the blame on each other and on him, and accused him of
            partiality to <i>Hiko.</i> They asked why he was to be set before the old men, and what
            he had to do with the land, to be considered for so much? Some of them even made some of
            their customary grimaces at Colonel Wakefield, expressive of defiance and contempt; and
            <i>Tungia</i> began dancing about and uttering a violent harangue, which seemed to
            indicate an intention to attack the ship. Some few small articles were pilfered from the
            heaps in the confusion, and taken ashore under the mats of slaves who had been set to do
            this.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> They threatened, and tried every means to intimidate Colonel
            Wakefield into proceeding with the affair. They said they would sell the land to the
            French and Americans, or to the ships from Port Jackson, of which they said plenty would
            come presently; and, finally, they expressed their determination to go to Port Nicholson
            and kill all our natives there.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Throughout this critical scene Colonel Wakefield displayed the most
            admirable courage and presence of mind. He laughed at their taunts, and treated their
            threats with indifference; and at length told them that they must leave the ship,
            whether the affair went on or not, if they could not behave more quietly. He refused
            their repeated proposals to buy their lands, and to leave <i>Hiko</i> to deal for his
            own; and managed, by exemplary command of temper and countenance, and by a due mixture
            of firmness and mildness in his replies, not only to subdue their riotous disposition,
            but</div>
        <h3>Reconciliation--The Deed Signed.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> to bring them round to as friendly a spirit as they had been in
            before the disagreement arose.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> After all had gone ashore but <i>Rauperaha</i> and <i>Tungia,</i>
            who remained in hopes of getting the two guns as presents, which they had selected and
            declared <i>tapu</i> for themselves, we again shifted our berth, in order to take up a
            more sheltered position. In doing this, we experienced a heavy tide-rip and some severe
            squalls off the island; and when, during one of these, the vessel careened over, and the
            spanker-boom flew in half, <i>Rauperaha</i> was in a most abject state of fear; asking
            me whether she would not turn right over, and repeating, as he stood trembling with his
            face to windward, a long, rapid incantation to the spirit of the gale. During one of our
            tacks, which extended to some distance, we increased his fears by a joking offer to take
            him to Port Nicholson, that he and <i>Tungia</i> might execute their purpose of killing
            <i>Warepori</i> and our natives. </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> On the 24th, <i>Rauperaha</i> and <i>Hiko</i> determined to make up
            their difference, and, unsolicited by Colonel Wakefield, came on board unattended. They
            looked for some time over some books of plates in the cabin, talking on different
            subjects, and then requested that the deed of conveyance might be read to them. This was
            done, and the whole translated and fully explained to them. The map was also again
            placed before them, and they pointed out the places to which they had a claim, saying,
            that no one lived on a great part of it, and that this part was of no use to any one,
            and least of all to them.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> They then both signed the deed; <i>Hiko</i> making a cross opposite
            his name with the pen which I held for him, but <i>Rauperaha</i> making a peculiar mark
            of his own with the pen in his own hand. They then left</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> the ship, each with his two-barrelled gun, and promised that the
            rest of the chiefs should sign the deed on the morrow, when the rest of the goods were
            to be delivered.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> On the next day this was done. <i>Rauperaha</i> and Charley signed
            by proxy for their relations in Cloudy Bay, and old <i>Te Wetu,</i> who was also
            present, but played only second fiddle among this <i>creme de la creme</i> of New
            Zealand aristocracy, for his son Mark, who was said to be of great authority in the
            neighbourhood of D'Urville's Island.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> It was agreed that a share for <i>Rangihaeata</i> should remain on
            board, and that his signature should be obtained at <i>Mana,</i> where he then was. He
            arrived, however, in a canoe, on the 26th; and after some blustering and speechifying,
            he signed the deed, and took his allotted share.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Nayti left us here, wishing to go and stop with his relations near
            <i>Mana</i> till the emigrant ships should arrive. On finding that all our persuasions
            and entreaties to him to remain with us were unavailing, Colonel Wakefield granted him
            permission to go; and he got into a canoe full of his friends bound for that place, with
            all his boxes and goods.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>Rauperaha,</i> who neglected no opportunity of plunder, had
            several times tried to profit by Nayti's former statement that they were nearly related.
            Although this was not the fact, he had on the earliest occasion demanded <i>utu</i> of
            Colonel Wakefield for having brought his <i>tamaiti,</i> or "child," in the ship; and on
            our receiving the account of the capsizing of our cutter one day, Nayti being one of the
            party on board, he ran to my uncle and claimed his relation's property, before we could
            possibly know whether any one was drowned or not. On another occasion, he had impu-
        </div>
        <h3>Rapacity Of Rauperaha.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> dently seized a gun belonging to Nayti, who was too much ashamed to
            say "no," but was almost crying with grief; and the robber would have carried it ashore
            had we not instantly interfered.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> After the sale, he was constantly coming on board to beg for
            whatever he saw or desired; and was once much annoyed by my giving a sword-stick to
            <i>Hiko,</i> the only one of the assembled chiefs in the cabin who, although admiring,
            had not asked for the treasure. <i>Rauperaha's</i> attempts to obtain things were
            incessant and untiring. Threats, prayers, and temptations, (such as offering to
            prostitute to Colonel Wakefield a young slave-girl from those on his island,) were all
            tried in succession; and, although constantly foiled, he seemed never to despair.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Colonel Wakefield, having visited <i>Waikanae,</i> was eagerly
            received by the missionary natives there, who offered to sell their land; but for no
            consideration except the munitions of war, as they wished to defend themselves against
            the <i>Ngatiraukawa.</i></div>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>E Patu,</i> and some other chiefs deputed from their number,
            went over with us to Queen Charlotte's Sound; where we intended to effect a contract
            with the <i>Ngatiawa</i> residing there, similar to that which we had concluded with the
            <i>Kawia</i> at <i>Kapiti.</i></div>
        <div class="jerningham"> A strong gale of wind off the entrance of the Sound, on the 29th,
            carried away our foreyard and some of our rigging, and left us in a very dangerous
            position in the midst of a boiling tide-rip, driving fast on to the Brothers. We
            escaped, however, by means of the superior sailing qualities of the Tory, and the
            admirable management of Captain Chaffers, and ran under the shelter of <i>Mana</i> to
            repair our damages.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> We found this island flat on the top, with high cliffs all round,
            except on the side towards the main, where</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> a snug amphitheatre contains the <i>pa</i> in which
            <i>Rangihaeata</i> and a few followers usually reside, and also the establishment of the
            White man owning the island. A small flock of sheep and fifty head of cattle, with two
            draught-horses, are attached to this sort of half-farm, half whaling-station. The
            ownership was in dispute between the last purchaser of this island and the agent of the
            last owner, a Sydney merchant, who had neglected to advise his agent of the sale.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> The first White owner of this island was a Mr. Bell; whose White
            widow, quite mad, lives among the natives, and has acquired all their habits and ways of
            living. <i>Mana</i> has since passed through the hands of many owners, all dependent on
            the caprice and humour of <i>Rangihaeata</i> and the other <i>Kawia</i> natives, who
            have been used to kill the sheep for their fleeces, and to commit other outrages at
            their will. During the late feast we were told that fifty sheep had been sacrificed.
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> On the 31st, we arrived in East Bay, opposite Ship Cove, followed
            in by a Bremen whaler who did not know the coast and wanted hands. I accompanied my
            uncle in a fatiguing walk over the hills to <i>Hokikare.</i> We ascended from Grass
            Cove, where the boat's crew of Captain Furneaux's ship was massacred and eaten in 1770.
            We found there two or three whalers' summer residences, and were served with a meal
            before proceeding.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> At <i>Hokikare</i> we found the natives preparing to embark for
            <i>Waikanae,</i> in order to take part in any fighting which might succeed the battle.
            <i>Tipi</i> had collected sixty picked men, with whom he meant to make a raid on
            <i>Rauperaha's</i> island, and seize him, in order to avenge the death of his father in
            some former snare laid by the old intriguer.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> We proceeded to Dicky Barrett's at <i>Te-awa-iti;</i> and</div>
        <h3>Funeral Of A Trader.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> having engaged the natives to postpone their expedition in order to
            take part in the treaty at East Bay, we returned to the ship in a boat. During our
            absence, Jacky Love, the trader whom I mentioned as having obtained the affection of the
            natives by his kindness and generosity, had died. Two hundred natives followed his body
            to the grave; and they subsequently erected a monument over it such as usually graces
            the tomb of a great chieftain. This was a canoe stuck upright in the ground, some 20
            feet high; painted in fanciful designs with red and black dye, and edged all round with
            a fringe of feathers. </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> From the 1st to the 8th of November was spent in negotiating with
            the natives, who collected to the number of three hundred, and formed encampments on the
            different islands and beaches near the ship, for a total cession of all their rights and
            claims. The same full explanations were made that had been used in the two former cases;
            and the same care taken that ample deliberation and due calmness should insure the
            perfect validity and truth of the transaction.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Much difficulty occurred, both during these discussions and at the
            distribution of the goods, in consequence of the absence of chieftains of great
            influence to take the lead in treating and speaking for the others. Innumerable petty
            disagreements had to be put an end to, and jealousies to be appeased; and as no one
            chief possessed sufficient authority to undertake this task, much more trouble and
            annoyance necessarily devolved upon Colonel Wakefield. His usual patience,
            determination, and good temper did not fail him; and he fully succeeded in conciliating
            their universal good-will.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> The result of this equality of authority among so wild a rabble
            gave rise to a disagreeable scene, during</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> the distribution of the goods after the execution of the deed by
            the numerous chiefs.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> One of the many smaller tribes composing the <i>Ngatiawa,</i>
            namely the <i>Puketapu,</i> consisted of particularly quarrelsome and unruly members;
            and, after the other tribes had taken their shares ashore, this one found it impossible
            to arrange the distribution without a <i>taua</i> or "scramble."</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> I was in the 'tween decks when it began; and, hearing a loud and
            continued stamping on the deck, thought the natives were "rushing" or attacking the
            ship. Under this impression, I sprang aft to obtain a weapon of defence from among those
            always ready in the cabin. On my way, I met <i>E Witi,</i> one of the chiefs of a tribe
            which had effected a quiet division; and he reassured me by telling me that no harm
            would be done to the White people, and that I had better go up in the rigging and look
            upon the way in which the natives divided their goods. </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Following his advice, I clambered up into the long-boat between the
            masts, and was at first bewildered at the sight. About one hundred and fifty natives
            were piled above the various heaps of goods, writhing, struggling, stamping, pulling
            each others' hair and limbs, tearing blankets, shivering whole cases of pipes and
            looking-glasses, and withal yelling and screaming in the most deafening manner. Some of
            the wildest had stripped naked. Disengaging themselves for a moment from the mass, they
            tightened the thong of their tomahawk-handle round their wrist, and prepared to plunge
            into the thickest of the mass, where some dearly-prized article was in contention among
            a heap of furies. Barrett, however, and some other White men well known to the natives,
            pinioned the arms of two or three of the wildest with their own, and gradually restored
        </div>
        <h3>A Scramble.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> order and peace. The combatants looked exceedingly crestfallen as
            they gathered up the remains of the broken things; but took especial pains to tell us
            that it was no fault of ours, but the <i>porangi</i> or "foolish-ness" of the
            <i>Maori.</i> Others, who had assumed a quiet, watchful attitude during the disturbance,
            smilingly produced from under their mats some chain-hook, sounding-lead, or other handy
            weapon, with which they had armed themselves in case of the worst.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> During the negotiations, our old tormentor at Ship Cove, "Dogskin,"
            once appeared alongside; but upon our recognizing him, although his costume was much
            altered, and pointing him out to the attention of Barrett and the surrounding natives,
            he was evidently much ashamed, and went right away. Nor did he ever return on board.
            <i>Ngarewa</i> attended the whole proceedings, and received his share of the payment.
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> On the 9th, Colonel Wakefield landed and took formal possession in
            the name of the Company.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> We had now obtained the rights and claims of a large proportion of
            the owners of land on both sides of Cook's Strait.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> The <i>Kawia</i> claimants by conquest, and the <i>Ngatiawa</i> or
            actual occupants, had both been satisfactorily dealt with in a general way. It remained
            to satisfy the tribes resident along the sea-coast of the northern shore, between
            <i>Waikanae</i> and the Sugar-loaf Islands. Colonel Wakefield left it to future times to
            deal with the <i>Ngatiawa</i> of <i>Waikanae,</i> many of whose chiefs had been
            concerned in this last affair, and who had seemed moreover well inclined to join in the
            transaction on the occasion of Colonel Wakefield's recent visit to them. He also
            postponed to a less disturbed season the idea of dealing with the <i>Ngatiraukawa.</i>
            And he resolved next to proceed to <i>Taranaki,</i> in order to satisfy the now scanty
            occupiers of that extensive and</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> fertile region, by the mediation of Barrett and the ambassadors
            from Port Nicholson.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Considering a large district as secured on each side of the Strait,
            only subject to satisfying the least important inhabitants, Colonel Wakefield named the
            two provinces respectively North and South Durham, in honour of the then Governor of the
            New Zealand Land Company.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Having promised a passage across to <i>Waikanae</i> to some of the
            chiefs, we sailed for <i>Kapiti</i> on the 11th; but a N. W. wind and baffling tide
            detained us in the Strait until the next morning. At daylight <i>Kapiti</i> lay about
            five miles to the S. E. of us. A small barque carrying the New Zealand flag passed
            between us and the island, and then hove to under our lee. We were in great hopes that
            this might prove our surveying-vessel, and hove to in order to communicate with her. A
            whale-boat came on board from the stranger, and soon dispersed our sanguine conjectures.
            She proved to be an American whaler, which, having been wrecked in the Bay of Islands,
            had been purchased by some one there, repaired, and fitted out under the New Zealand
            flag, and sent down here to take up a whaling captain, previous to going on a voyage in
            the South Seas. Captain Lewis, or "Horse" Lewis, as he was more generally called, the
            American of whom I have spoken before as heading a station on one of the small islets
            near <i>Kapiti,</i> was the man of whom they were in search, and the sailing captain
            came on board of us to ask where <i>Kapiti</i> was. We shewed it to him under his nose,
            and told him to follow us in to the anchorage; giving him also as pilot an old whaler
            who accompanied Barrett, named Heberly, but more commonly known as "Worser." We then
            rounded the north point of <i>Kapiti,</i> and anchored in the outer roadstead off
            Evans's Island. The whaling barque was christened</div>
        <h3>War Canoes.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>Tokerau</i> on her adoption of a new flag. This is the native
            name of the Bay of Islands, and signifies literally "the hundred rocks." </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> We found that during our absence a barque had been here from
            Sydney, with an agent sent to purchase land for Messrs. Cooper and Levi, merchants in
            that place. The whalers told us that he had purchased <i>Kapiti;</i> which we knew to
            have been purchased already so many times, that we omitted both that and <i>Mana</i>
            from the list of places to which we had bought the natives' rights. This agent had also
            bought a piece of land on the main near <i>Waikanae;</i> and he had, although informed
            by every one that the natives had made the whole of their rights over to Colonel
            Wakefield a few days before, declared that he would buy any land in order to prevent the
            Tory from obtaining it. He had accordingly promised to give a small schooner for the
            <i>Ohiere,</i> or Pelorus River.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> We were detained a week here by a succession of light baffling
            winds and calms.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> During this interval, <i>Warepori</i> and several other chiefs from
            Port Nicholson, who had joined the muster at <i>Waikanae,</i> came across in their
            war-canoes to see us. On one occasion, three, well manned and armed, bearing together
            nearly one hundred men, came alongside. They look very pretty when at full speed. The
            finely-carved head and stern of the canoe are ornamented with feathers of the pigeon and
            albatross; and bunches of the latter plumage, or of that of the gannet, are disposed
            along the batten which covers the joint of the bottom and top side of the canoe. The men
            are placed at equal intervals along either side to paddle; and they keep excellent
            stroke to the song of two leaders, who stand up and recite alternate short sentences,
            giving the time with a <i>taiaha</i> or long wooden spear. Two ex-</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> perienced hands in the stern use larger paddles for steering.
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> The <i>taiaha</i> is rather a long-handled club than a spear. It is
            generally made of <i>manuka,</i> a very hard, dark, close-grained, and heavy wood. When
            polished with oil, it becomes nearly black. The <i>taiaha</i> is about six feet long. At
            one end is carved a representation of a man's head, thrusting out his tongue, which
            forms a sort of spear-head. His eyes are represented by small pieces of the
            mother-o'-pearl-like shell, which I have before alluded to as used for their fish-hooks,
            let into the wood. The tongue and face are all minutely carved so as to represent the
            <i>tatu.</i> Above the forehead, a part of the stalk of the weapon is covered with the
            bright-red feathers from under the wing of the <i>haka</i> or large parrot, to represent
            the hair; and an abundant tuft of long, white dog's-hair imitates the feathers or
            head-dress. The <i>taiaha</i> is held just above the dog's-hair, and flourished in the
            right hand with the tongue downwards. From this place the stalk gradually expands into a
            flat, sharp-edged blade, about three inches wide at the end; and this is the part used
            to strike in fighting, both hands managing the weapon like a quarter-staff.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>Warepori</i> could hardly talk about the prospect of the
            settlers arriving at Port Nicholson. His mind was quite unsettled by the warlike aspect
            of affairs, and he spoke of the probability of his death in the approaching contest. We
            ascertained that about 800 fighting-men had mustered at <i>Waikanae,</i> and that there
            would soon be 600 more of the <i>Ngatiawa</i> tribe from different parts of the Strait.
        </div>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>Rauperaha</i> had been for some time at <i>Otaki,</i> as it was
            supposed inciting the <i>Ngatiraukawa</i> to renew the attack.</div>
        <h3>Warepori And Rauperaha.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> One day that <i>Warepori</i> was talking to us on deck, we spied a
            strong, large canoe stealing along under the land of <i>Kapiti,</i> about a mile from
            us, and apparently anxious to escape observation. On applying the spy-glasses, we made
            out the "Old Sarpent," or "Satan," as the whalers call him, crouching down in his canoe,
            and occasionally casting a timid glance towards the crowd of canoes which surrounded our
            ship, and urging his men to pull harder. He had just returned from <i>Otaki,</i> and
            seemed anxious to reach his own island unobserved by the <i>Ngatiawa. Warepori,</i>
            however, who had made him out as soon as any of us, manned his war-canoe and started at
            racing-pace to cut off his retreat. Forty paddles against six or seven was no fair
            match. <i>Rauperaha,</i> after an ineffectual attempt to effect the passage between the
            innermost islet and <i>Kapiti,</i> and so avoid the rencontre, found his manoeuvring of
            no avail, and the two canoes remained motionless at half musket-shot. The particulars of
            the interview were related to me by some natives on <i>Hiko's</i> island the same
            evening.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>Warepori</i> reproached him with his constant intriguing and
            setting their enemies against the <i>Ngatiawa.</i> He warned him of what might happen to
            himself should these latter prove victorious.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> <i>Rauperaha</i> answered in the most submissive manner, that he
            had no such designs; and abjured all fighting, saying that he would yield <i>Kapiti</i>
            to <i>Warepori,</i> and retire himself to <i>Wairau,</i> near Cloudy Bay.</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Having thus appeased his interlocutor's anger, he invited him
            ashore to a meal; and apparent friendly relations lasted on the two islets inhabited by
            <i>Hiko</i> and <i>Rauperaha</i> all the night. The latter did not come on board of us,
            but returned to <i>Otaki.</i></div>
        <div class="jerningham"> On the 17th, we had got our anchor up, and sailed a</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> little way before a light southerly breeze, which failed, however,
            when we had got opposite to <i>Waikanae.</i></div>
        <div class="jerningham"> While we were anchored with a kedge, three chiefs, belonging to the
            <i>Wanganui</i> tribes, came off from <i>Waikanae</i> to commence negotiations for the
            sale of their district. They were allied to the <i>Ngatiawa,</i> and had taken great
            part in the defence of the place on the 16th of last month. They heard all the usual
            explanations, described the boundaries within which their claims lay, and, after
            receiving a fowling-piece each in part payment, signed a deed which had been translated
            to them. Two of them, <i>Te Kiri Karamu</i> and <i>Te Rangi Wakarurua,</i> returned on
            shore. <i>Kuru Kanga,</i> the son of the latter, and principal chief of <i>Wanganui,</i>
            remained on board to show us the entrance of the river, and that we might land him to
            prepare his people for the completion of the purchase on our return. He was an active,
            intelligent man; and seemed highly anxious to have White men among his people. He was
            attended by a slave, who acted famously as valet-de-chambre, anticipating the slightest
            want of his master. This chief had taken a distinguished part in the battle of
            <i>Waikanae.</i> He was universally known as a brave warrior and skilful general; and I
            have since been told by <i>Watanui, E Ahu,</i> and other principal chiefs of the
            <i>Ngatiraukawa,</i> that, had it not been for his determined gallantry and that of his
            attendants, they should have won the day. On the morning of the 18th, as we lay nearly
            becalmed off the sandy beach between <i>Waikanae</i> and <i>Otaki, Rauperaha</i> came on
            board, on his way from the latter place to <i>Kapiti.</i> He seemed ill at ease,
            although we greeted him kindly notwithstanding our aversion for his character. He asked
            for some grog, and then took an early opportunity of stating, in the most bare-</div>
        <h3>Rauperaha Repudiates His Bargain.</h3>
        <div class="jerningham"> faced way, that he should sell some land to the vessel from Port
            Jackson, as he wanted more guns, and had only sold us <i>Taitapu</i> and
            <i>Rangitoto;</i> that is, Blind Bay and D'Urville's Island!</div>
        <div class="jerningham"> Colonel Wakefield reproached him instantly, and in the strongest
            terms, with his falsehood and duplicity; making Brooks, the interpreter, repeat to him
            several times that he had behaved as a liar and a slave, instead of a great chief.
            <i>Rauperaha</i> maintained, however, an imperturbable silence, giving no answer to this
            severe attack, or to the reproaches which all the cabin-party addressed to him. He
            demanded and drank another glass of grog, and then got into his canoe, which pulled for

        <div class="jerningham"> We were of course much hurt by this rapid repudiation of his
            bargain; and, though we depended entirely upon the perfect justice and openness of the
            agreement which we had made with him, before so many witnesses and in such explicit
            terms, for our justification before the world, we foresaw some obstacles already arrayed
            against the peaceful settlement of the Strait during the life of this deceitful old
            savage. It seemed natural to suppose, however, that, whether obliged to govern and
            protect ourselves, or acknowledged and fostered, as we hoped, by the British Government,
            we should always possess a force able to protect the plantations against any of his evil
            designs, and to maintain the execution of any just bargain, whether or not he should be
            inclined to abide by it at a future period.</div>
